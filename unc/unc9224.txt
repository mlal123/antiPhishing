I just sent a note to everyone that I believe is graduating in May.with a
BS, BA or minor in computer science.

1) If you are graduating in May and did NOT receive the email, please send
me a note.  remember to include your PID.

2) If you are graduating in August and want to walk in May, please send me
an email with your PID and what you are doing to complete your degree.  YOU
SHOULD DO THIS EVEN IF YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ME.

Thanks,
Diane
