Hey everyone,


At our last staff meeting, some o=
f you asked for an updated list of the desk tasks that need to be performed=
 during your shifts at the desk! Below, I've broken down what each shift ta=
sk is by hour and included information
 on how to complete the task! Additionally, you can find these instructions=
 on pages 25-27 of the black binder in the drawer of the OCUQ office desk! =
While the times of the tasks in the binder do not match the times that I've=
 assigned for the summer, the instructions
 are still the same! Please contact me personally with any questions that y=
ou have!
