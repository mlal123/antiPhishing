Next week is the biggest week of recruiting for the semester. By the end of
February, most employers have finished up their recruiting and will begin
doing interviews. *Please don't miss out on the Job & Internship Expo and
the LInCS event this coming Thursday! *(details below) See the attached
spreadsheet that I created to help you research employers that will be at
the Expo and hiring CS students. They are highlighted in yellow.  *Arrive
prepared to:* Introduce yourself (name, year, major, interest/skills),
provide your updated resume (make sure current projects are included), and
ask educated questions based on the research you've done on the company
and/or position. It could be as simple as asking a pointed question about
their software engineering internship you read about. Maybe you ask about
projects past interns have worked on or what top skills or qualities they
look for in an ideal candidate. The point here is to go in showing that you
know something about them (they LOVE that) rather than walking up and
asking "what do you guys do? or "do you have CS internships?"

*UNC Clean Tech Summit | March 2-3rd | UNC Friday Center | $40 for both
days*
The 4th Annual Summit will bring together professionals in business,
policy, and academia from across the state and region for two days of
discussion, workshops, mentoring and networking to foster leadership and
growth in the southeast=E2=80=99s clean tech industry. The most important a=
spect
about the Clean Tech Summit is that is has become a type of career event.
There is a growing number of students who have turned contacts they made
there into summer internships and jobs. One great example of what this
event can do for students is a student who is only 22 and started working
part-time and then did a co-op like internship for eight months during her
junior year.  She kept working up to 30 hours a week during her senior
year.  She was one of the first seven people hired and today that company
has hundreds of employees and she is in a high position. The Summit has the
following career activities this year:
*Thursday 2/3 *
Women in Stem Luncheon with women from a diversity of industries. They are
defining STEM not just in the traditional way but to include all innovative
careers like finance, marketing etc.
Mentoring program- Students can sign up to see if we can match them with a
relevant mentor from industry, government or the non-profit sector.
*Friday 3/3*
Career networking lunch (students get to bounce around to different
companies and speak with a representative from that company- set up like
speed dating.

This is also a good event for younger students to get an idea of careers
and for them to begin to build their network. More advanced students have
the chance of finding a job or internship. Here is a link to this year's
event: http://ie.unc.edu/cleantech/
