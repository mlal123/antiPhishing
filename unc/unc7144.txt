From: Megan Eagen (galileo) - galileo@email.unc.eduFolks,  As with Unit Exam #1, Tuesday's test will include two short essays. Topics were indicated in class, but just in case anyone didn't get the memo:  Essay #1: Ethics of the Motown finishing school/"the charm school"  Essay #2: Elements of psychedelia in the Beatles's "A Day in the Life"  Hope the studying is going well!
