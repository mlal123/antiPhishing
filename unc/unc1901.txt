Good morning Mangza,
 
Our office only offers loans to students for summer school financial aid (whether you are Carolina Covenant or not). As a Carolina Covenant student, you have not received any
 loans during the academic year. This means that you have your entire loan eligibility available for the summer financial aid.

 
The financial aid for 2016-17 has not been awarded because we have not received, linked, and processed the additional documents requested. You will be reevaluated for Carolina
 Covenant status once the documents are completely processed. 
 

Sincerely,

Hello, so I got Federal Direct Loan on my financial aid items. Does that mean I'm no longer a Carolina covenant member?
