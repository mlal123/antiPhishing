We can use help at graduation on May13.  We need a few people to help out
at the ceremony at Carmichael (handing out programs and making sure the
graduates get seated properly) as well as manning the ice cream and cake
stations back at Sitterson for guests who make it back from Carmichael
before the faculty.  Please let me know if you are interested.

Thanks,
Diane
