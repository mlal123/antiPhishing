The biggest unknowns in media in 2018=


BY JAMES WARREN =B7 JANU=
ARY 2, 2018

 

Will the media's race for clickbait subside, the Facebook-Google ad =
Goliath be slowed? And which consumers will pay for content?<=
/u>

New Year's Day brought loads of dishes, the engrossing college football=
 semi-finals (what a Georgia-Oklahoma game), NFL coach firings, White House=
 reporters cooling their heels in
 a Palm Beach IHOP as President Trump played golf =97 and the final re=
mnants of a holiday media staple: top 10 lists.
 
But wait. What about asking smart media folks what they don't know&=
nbsp;about what beckons in 2018? Yes, what about opening the year with =
a search for modesty not always associated with the press? So let's tr=
ack down a diverse group of smarties and ask what
 they'd love to ask a crystal ball =97 and maybe run to Las Vegas with the =
knowledge.

Hamilton Nolan, senior writer at Splinter and former =
Gawker stalwart: "I'd like to know how
 we're all going to keep having jobs while Google and Facebook are taking a=
ll the ad money."

Mike Allen, Axios co-founder: "Will social platf=
orms truly reward =97 with real monetization
 =97 publishers who produce first-class, worthy content without trashy, clu=
nky web pages, annoying pop-up ads and hidden trackers that slow load times=
?=94

Jon Steinberg, founder of Cheddar: "When I start=
ed Cheddar I never could have foreseen the
 acceleration of amazing OTT (over the top) platforms like Sling, DirecTV N=
ow, Philo, Fubo, YouTube TV, Sony Vue, etc. I wonder where we will be in a =
year. How old will the incumbent cable news audiences get? Which bundles wi=
ll replace traditional MVPDs (multichannel
 video programming distributors)? Which post cable networks will take =
share from incumbents? What will TV in 2018 be?"=


Cenk Uygur, founder of The Young Turks: "1. How =
well will the skinny bundles monetize? How
 many subscribers can they bring in? What percentage of inventory will be f=
illed? What will be the CPMs? What will 'ratings' look like? How well =
will standalone channels do on platforms like Amazon?"

"2. Can any digital media company survive on programmatic and bran=
ded advertising alone? A corollary to this question is whether advertisers =
will ever figure out where their under-35-year-old
 customers went (hint: It's not television)?"

Lowell Peterson, executive director of the Writers Gu=
ild of America, East: "Will the sexual
 harassment scandal finally move the entertainment industry past hand-wring=
ing and focus groups on the issue of diversity toward something that will a=
ctually make a difference =97 that is, meaningful progress on diverse hirin=
g and diverse storytelling? An industry
 that does not reflect the diversity of our culture, and that consequently =
permits radical imbalance in representation and power, is not sustainable i=
n the long run."

Howard Tullman, serial entrepreneur and CEO of the le=
ading Chicago startup hub, 1871: "How
 soon will regular businesses benefit by the implementation of the blockcha=
in technologies which will eliminate millions of man-hours of wasted time a=
nd redundant activities? Using smart contracts, JP Morgan eliminated 360,00=
0 hours of useless lawyer time reviewing
 standard contracts already."

Kathy Kiely, former longtime Washington reporter-edit=
or now teaching journalism at the University
 of New Hampshire: "Will news organizations end the self-destructive r=
ace for clickbait and take a chance on giving members of the public what th=
ey need to know, instead of a steady diet of what they want to know? (Do we=
 dare write about issues instead of Trump's
 latest tweet?)"

"As a corollary, will the public begin to understand that finding =
the culprit for everything that they hate about the media is as simple as l=
ooking in the mirror? Chartbeat tells us
 all we'd rather not know about your viewing and reading habits. If you wan=
t better movies, TV shows, stories, you're going to have to vote with your =
clicks. That means changing habits."

She also wants to know, "Will the major institutions of civil soci=
ety =97 political, media, educational =97 undertake the massive public heal=
th campaign it's going to take to get all of
 us to improve our media diets? What we did with tobacco, we're going to ha=
ve to do with fake news and other media junk food: Identify the threat it p=
oses (in this case to the body politic, not the body), enlighten people abo=
ut how to make healthier choices
 and help people who are already addicted. As with tobacco, it will take lo=
nger than a year to break the addiction, but will we start the effort?"=
;

Jon Margolis, retired (to Vermont) former chief polit=
ical writer for the Chicago Tribune:
 "I would like to know: Will reporters figure out that they should sto=
p tweeting? Of at least tweet a lot less. Reporting and writing a story is =
a day=92s work. It is not necessary (and often gets one in trouble) to wast=
e time and energy venting one=92s spleen
 about whatever."

Clay Shirky, an Internet expert at New York Universit=
y, wants to know about user-supported
 media: "2018 is a perfect test-case for user-supported media. By the =
end of the year, we'll know if we passed or failed that test."<=
u>

"It's a very big question. Ad-supported media long reigned. Now, n=
ewspapers are about to begin their 49th consecutive quarter of year-on-year=
 revenue declines." Their attempts have
 failed in essentially saying, "Just like paying for shoes you like, y=
ou must pay for news," conceptualizing it all as a sales transaction, =
he says.

"NPR has the right model. People do not regard news as a product, =
and 'pay or else' does not motivate enough of them to subscribe. The messag=
e that does work is 'You need us, and if
 you don't pitch in, we will go away.' The mindset of the media subscr=
iber is not 'I must pay for what I consume,' but 'God forbid there not be a=
 New York Times.' "

"There is clearly no ad-supported alternative for most reporting, =
and especially local reporting. The obvious alternative is to find a small =
group of committed citizens in those cities
 and towns, enough to support the investigative journalism we need."

"Most of what's in a paper has more than adequate substitutes onli=
ne, from display ads and sports pages to the horoscope and classifieds. The=
 one irreplaceable function =97 actual journalism
 =97 has to be supported by the people who need it. 2018 will tell us if th=
ere are enough people who care enough to keep that journalism alive."<=
