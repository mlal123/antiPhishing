ng comprehensive leadership development, I strongly encourage you to apply =
to the Bonner Leaders program.  The application is online at  http://campus=
-y.unc.edu/get-involved/bonner-leaders-program/apply-to-be-a-bonner and is =

r interest and I'll be back in touch soon!

NOTE: The Work-Study office encourages students to apply for at least 3 job=

er Leaders Program, you should notify the other job that you have been acce=
pted to the Bonner program and would have to decline their offer.  We will =
