Hey Morrison,

My name is Andy Kane and I am the Morrison Community Director. I had the pl=

xtend my thanks and appreciation for choosing Morrison this year. The Resid=
ent Advisors, Office Assistants, Housekeepers, and Facilities Techs and I l=
ook forward to making this year as great as it can be.

I just wanted to highlight a few things this week before life gets too hect=

e, snacks, and tea in the lobby propelling you into the first day of classe=
s.
- From 7:30pm - 9:30pm we are having our Morrison Kickoff Event on the bask=
etball court. There will be S'mores, Ice Cream, games, and (most importantl=
y) a chance to meet the folks you will awkwardly stand in the elevator with=
 all year.

Wednesday and Thursday
- If you are looking for a great way to get involved or connect with your c=
ommunity, the Residence Hall Association is hosting two interest meetings f=

Front Desk
Also, tomorrow we start checking out "enhancements" at the Community Offfic=

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to support y'all. I'm alwa=
