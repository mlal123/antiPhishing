From: Buck Goldstein (goldstb) - buck_goldstein@unc.eduHello All  I am looking forward to seeing most of you in person next week and tw=
o of you via Skype (or whatever you decide).  Bernard is also looking =
forward to his time with you in Yosemite. I wanted to review a few things p=
rior to our time together.  1.  Be sure you are signed up for a=
 time to present.  If you are having trouble getting signed up, talk w=
ith Chris who posted the link to the schedule. I assume we have access to y=
our normal classroom and there is audio visual equipment available to displ=
ay your slides.  I'll communicate with one of you to be sure the =
room is in order.  2.  Some of you have asked to get together p=
rivately.  I'll plan to have office hours in the afternoon after the p=
resentations and we will do a sign up in class.  3.  Take your =
final presentations seriously.  I will.  Other than your weekly s=
ubmissions I will have nothing other than the presentations to base your fi=
nal grade upon.  Your performance during the semester in class with Je=
nnifer and at your internship all counts for the grade that Jennifer gives.=
  I plan to count the weekly submissions for 20% of the grade and the =
final presentation for 80%.  I will have a rough grading rubric for my=
 own purposes but in general what I am looking for is a demonstration of tw=
o things: 1) that you have assimilated the lessons from boot camp, the=
 weekly sessions and most importantly the real life experience of the inter=
nship and have thought deeply about them: and 2) that you made the most of =
your time in the Bay Area. This second point will be different for each of =
you. It is like the "why I am here" session from boot camp b=
ut the questions are "What's changed and what's next"? =
There is no simple formula for getting an A (like the number of active user=
s from boot camp) so knock yourself out!!!  See you soon.  &n=
