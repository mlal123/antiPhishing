			Hope the end of finals are going well for you. It will all be over soon =
if you haven't already finished! Just a quick reminder before you leave for=
 break about the closing policies.
		
			Everyone must be out of the residence hall by Saturday, 12/17, at 10:00 =
AM. After that, the flex passes will be cut off so you won't be able to get=
 back into the hall. The two exceptions are people who are graduating and c=
an stay until Sunday at noon, or people who have requested to stay here ove=
r the break. If you need to stay for either of these, you should have reque=
sted to do so already from our community director. Let me know ASAP if not.=

		
			Also, when you leave, make sure you turn off all lights, close your wind=
ows, lock your doors, and don't forget to defrost your refrigerators.
		
			Have a merry Christmas and happy holidays over break!
