You can move in as early as Wednesday the 16th so yes, you can move in on Friday. You can just come and we'll let you in. You don't need any form or anything. Just show up and we'll take care of you.

Hi Mangza,



My name is eddie torres and i am going to be a resident on the 10th floor of morrison. I already know my move in date is set for saturday, however my parents arent availible to help me move in that day. I am an out of state student too ao i dont have much flexibility.
 I was wondering if i could move in friday afternoon instead, and what i would need to do in order to be allowed to do so.



Thanks,
