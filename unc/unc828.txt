Hi All,  Due to a scheduling conflict with a conference I'm attending this weekend, I won't be able to be with you in class on Friday. Morgan Souza, a fellow English 105 instructor will be covering your class, and you'll be working toward your second feeder--a scene dissection. Please come to class with the ability to re-watch your chosen scene from your film (this means headphones, and either the DVD or a Netflix-or-equivalent setup). You may need to coordinate with your group-members about who will check out the DVD. Your instructions for class will be in our class notes (feel free to preview them if you'd like).  Happy working, and I will see you all on Monday!  Best,  Katie
