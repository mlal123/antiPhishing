Good morning,

We are looking for up to four students to teach a week-long summer camp for
middle school girls the week of July 24-28.

The curriculum will be provided by GE, but there is room for instructor
input.

This is a paid opportunity.

Please let me know if you are interested, and I can provide additional
information.

Thanks,

Gina
