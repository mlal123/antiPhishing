BUSI 101 Students,

I have returned from vacation and am in the process of responding to all requests that have come in to change recitation sections, due to your existing schedules. 

Please note that the deadline for the Undergraduate Business Program to process BUSI 101 recitation changes will be: Monday, August 22, 2016 at 8:00AM. No BUSI 101 Recitation changes will be processed by our office after this date. Therefore, please email me by then at: Koyah_Rivera@kenan-flagler.unc.edu if you would like to switch to another recitation section, having met the parameters of the conditions for a change.

Important Note: Recitation changes will only be made due to schedule-related conflicts involving multiple classes on the day of your assigned recitation or another obligation on the assigned recitation date up until the August 22nd deadline. 

Sincerely,
