Good morning,

We are seeking additional participants today for a research study. We have
an immediate deadline approaching and are hoping for some additional
participation, and we are seeking participation today only.

 The study consists of using the HTC vive to observe a few sets of crowds
in Virtual Reality and actually walking through the virtual crowds in VR.
Participation takes about 30 minutes and you will be compensated with a
gift-card for $10. We would really appreciate your taking some time to come
experience this interesting VR study.

If you are interested, please email me at best@cs.unc.edu to schedule a
time.

*Title: * "Interacting With Intelligent Virtual Agents in Virtual Reality"
*IRB #: *16-0705
*Purpose: *To quantify the advantages of a new multi-agent planner for
simulating characters in virtual environments
