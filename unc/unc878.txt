Hi,

You're receiving this email because you are a Carolina Covenant Scholar and
a CS major. I'd like to see us get to the place where every CS major with
work-study funding gets a chance to work in CS where you can learn valuable
skills and get connected to the community.

If you are interested, please email me and we'll see what we can do to make
it happen.
