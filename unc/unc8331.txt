The next meetup will take place Thursday (tomorrow) at 1789 (173 E Frank=
lin St.) from 6PM onwards. =
We'll be led by Spencer Schneier in discussing the difference between unsig=
ned transaction output and account based blockchains- think Bitcoin=
 vs Ethereum. From your responses so far, it seems that Thursday's=
 might be the best times for meetups and Saturdays for hack sessions. If yo=
u haven't yet filled in your available times, please do so here.

Also if you haven't joined the Telegram, you can do so here. It's the fastest way to a=
sk questions, stay attuned to updates, and start a conversation.

To those of you who indicated interest in leadership, my apologies for t=
he delay. We're obviously still small and currently figuring out what will =
work best. If you haven't done so and are interested, please fill out this =
brief form here. 

Best,
