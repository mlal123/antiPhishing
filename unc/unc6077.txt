Hi all -

Please take a moment to log into TIM and approve your timecard for *the
previous pay period* that ended on Sunday, 9/3.  *You have until 12 pm
noon today* to approve your timecard for the previous pay period.

Since we have lots of new folks, just a reminder that you should log into
TIM with your onyen, and once it has opened your timecard, click in the
upper right to change it to "previous pay period".  Only once you are
showing the previous pay period, you can go over to the left and click on
the approve icon.

Please see screen shots below -

And then click approve over on the left -

*Please make sure you are in the previous pay period before you approve* -
if you approve the current pay period, your approval cannot be removed so
we will have to manually enter your times for you for the remainder of the
pay period (i.e. the next two weeks).  Just double-check before you hit "
approve".

Thanks!  As always let me know if you have questions!
