Hi Mangza,


I got this email from Hannah, since I'll be grading your paper this time=
 around. All your points seem to be valid, and your overall thesis is very =
good- it certainly derives something interesting from the reading we have d=
one so far this semester. 
What play are you using besides Medea? You clearly have some poin=
ts marked out, but from which play? Several could work, of course, but whic=
h one in particular? I'm especially interested because I think that conside=
ring your thesis, you need to address
 Apollo's assertion at the end of the Furies that marriage relations=
hips are actually more important than kin relationships. There are several =
ways you can get around this, but since it's an obvious counter-example you=
 should probably save a paragraph
 or two to address it.
All-in-all, this looks very good early in the game. Good luck writing!          =

Hello Hannah! I was wondering if you could take a quick look at my tenta=

thank you!

Thesis: In ancie=
nt greek civilization marriage didn’t
 have a significant value in society, especially when compared to the value=
 of kinship, and this is due to the fact that greek society had general bia=
