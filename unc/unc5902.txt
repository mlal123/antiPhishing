Welcome (back) to school! We know that summer wasn't *quite* as long as =
we would've liked, but with all the new events coming up, we're ready to ge=
t a kick start into the year!

Firstly is club communication. We have a couple important Facebook pages=
 - please join these if you use Facebook, as they are our primary way of li=
nking with the community!

UNC Esports - https://w=
ww.facebook.com/UNCesports/
UNC League of Legends - https://www.facebook.com/groups/UNCLoL/

If you haven't already, please go and request access to those pages and =
we'll approve them as we get them. That being said, don't worry too much if=
 you don't have or use Facebook - we will be emailing about major events an=
d meetings to ensure that we reach everyone who wants to come.

Most importantly, we will be hosting our Fall General Body Meeti=
ng (GBM) next Thursday (August 31) from 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM in Fred Brooks 00=

We'll be answering a lot of important questions concerning the styles of=
 events we're holding, how we're addressing your feedback from last year, a=
nd what our goals are for the club in the coming semester. The schedule for=
 our first few events will also be released then. We strongly encourage all=
 new (and old!) members to come out and hear about the changes and upcoming=
 events. This will also be a good opportunity to meet your fellow summoners=
 that you'll be fighting alongside this year, so be sure to mark it on your=
 calendars!
