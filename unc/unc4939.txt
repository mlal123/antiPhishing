G cryptography tool.  This meeting will be hands-on and lead by our ow=
n Forrest Li, a graduate student here at UNC.  If you are planning to =
attend, we recommend you install GPG from https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html. &n=
bsp;Binaries for Win/Mac/Linux can be found at the bottom of the page.

			2. UNC GWiCS has asked me to include the following
		
			 
		
			    Poster & Demo Session (March 30, 6 - 8PM):
		
			    Learn about recent research in the fields of security, vis=
ion, graphics, computational biology, real-time systems, robotics and more!=
 This is a great opportunity for students to practice presenting their rese=
arch and to learn about the research others are doing.

 this conference will inspire students from all backgrounds to incorporate =
design-thinking as part of their innovation process and to use it as a tool=
 in their tech and business-related endeavors. Just as engineers have done =
with computer science and hackathons, we’re looking to bring design t=
