Hi Michael

I'm a former sales-trader at Barclays Capital who recently left banking to =
co-found Finimize, a daily financial news email that's sophisticated enough for Wall Street=
 but understandable enough for everyone. We take the most important stories=
 of that day, briefly summarize them and, most importantly, tell our reader=
s why they're important. You can see a recent email here.

The members of UNC's Business Technology Club should find it useful during =
their time at UNC and also, particularly, if they're considering a career i=
n professional services (obviously Finimize is helpful if their targeted field is finance b=
ut it's also great for consulting, marketing, accounting, etc. because it's=
 quick and relevant to business in general). I am wondering whether you wou=
ld be willing to share Finimize among your members, perhaps via an email or FB post? It wou=
ld be great to have your members join the tens of thousands of students and=
 young professionals that are already using Finimize!

Let me know if you'd like me to provide a blurb that you can use - and if y=
ou have any questions!

Many thanks in advance,
