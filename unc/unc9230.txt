Hello everyone

My name is Nikhil, and I serve as HackNC co-lead alongside Armaan. For
those of you who don=E2=80=99t know, HackNC is one of UNC=E2=80=99s yearly =
hackathons. With
almost 600 attendees yearly, planning an event of this scale takes time and
coordination, which is why we need all the help we can get. This Thursday,
April 19th in FB007 at 9:30 PM, we will hold our first official meeting for
2018. The door closest to FB007 will be open. If you=E2=80=99re interested =
in
helping out, or just want to learn more, please attend this meeting! If you
have any questions, or are unable to attend, please email me at
nikhilk@live.unc.edu or Armaan at armaan@live.unc.edu.   If you would like
to keep up with future events, please sign up on our listserv at
https://goo.gl/forms/Sn0C1l6bSV8kNYF82.


Thank you all very much!
