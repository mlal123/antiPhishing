*"Calling all creative developers! *



Interested in helping build a new online community for artists of all
disciplines? Instead of dividing creatives by field (ie. musicians on
Soundcloud vs filmmakers on Vimeo vs designers on Dribbble), Kollaboh
 is an online platform for all artists to connect,
form teams and collaborate in real-time. Essentially, imagine if LinkedIn
and Slack had a baby together and once that child went on to college, it
decided to major in the arts over business.



My name is Kelly Foran , Kollaboh's
founder, and I'm currently looking for CS students interested in partnering
to help make Kollaboh a reality. Experience with JavaScript+Node.js+Meteor,
Ruby+Rails, or PHP is ideal and if you're fascinated by blockchain
technology, that's a plus!


Although I can't financially hire an employee at this point (I'm a recent
college grad), I'm motivated to find potential partners who embrace new
challenges, are down to gain some startup experience, and are passionate
about music, design, film and all art.



If you're interested, please reach out to kollaboh@gmail.com and introduce
yourself. Cheers!"
