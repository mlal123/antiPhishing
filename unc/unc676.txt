*GENWORTH Tech Talk- **USB Attack to Decrypt Wi-Fi Communications**: *@
5:30pm in SN011
The term =E2=80=9CBad USB=E2=80=9D has gotten some much needed press in las=
t few months.
There have been talks that have identified the risks that are caused by the
inherent trust between the OS and any device attached by USB. I found in my
research that most of the available payloads for the USB rubber ducky would
be stopped by common enterprise security solutions. I then set out to
create a new exploit that would force the victim to trust my
Man-In-The-Middle access point. After my payload is deployed, all Wi-Fi
communications will be readable, including usernames, passwords and
authentication cookies. The attack will work without the need of elevating
privileges, which makes it ideal for corporate environments.

*RED HAT Tech Talk: *@ 5:30pm in SN 011

Interested in learning about how Red Hat is changing the way people build
applications and how you can become a part of it?  Join us to hear about
how OpenShift (https://www.openshift.com/), the latest generation of
Platform as a Service built on Kubernetes (http://kubernetes.io/) and
Docker (https://www.docker.com/), is the biggest change to computing since
virtual machines.  Expect to hear about OpenShift's technical architecture
as well as Red Hat's approach to open source software engineering.  And if
that isn't enough, food will be provided and we are hiring!

*Other Opportunities:*


*Quora Internships:*

Quora is a group of exceptionally talented people all working together to
share and grow the world's knowledge. We believe our progress toward this
mission will have a great long-term impact on the world. When people have
access to more knowledge, they can make better decisions, find better jobs
and do them better, solve problems in their life, raise their families
better, and much more. Much of the fundamental work has yet to be done.
Low-hanging fruit is everywhere. The vast majority of knowledge is still
not on the internet -- that is the opportunity in front of us.

Every intern will have a full-time data scientist as a mentor and weekly
1:1s with their managers to get feedback and ensure things are going well

To give you a taste of what interns could do at Quora, here are some
projects interns have worked on in the past:

=C2=B7         Building predictive models for user engagement

=C2=B7         Constructing Feed features

=C2=B7         Research on statistical methodology of running experiments

=C2=B7         Building tools to visualize how users navigate Quora

=C2=B7         Development on our experiment analysis framework

* Security & Internet of Things: *

*A world of possibilities!*





Our next THINK Event is open to everyone age 10 and up. Why? Because
everywhere around us there are objects that can connect to the Internet --
from smart phones to TV's to thermostats, refrigerators and cars. Have you
ever stopped to wonder that with so many devices connected, collecting and
transmitting data about our lives, what are the security implications of
these "Things"? How do we protect ourselves as they become ever embedded
within our homes, work, and lives?

This public event is designed for all ages to enlighten us on the exciting
opportunities - and security implications - of IoT. Gartner, Inc.
 estimates that there are
nearly 5 billion "Things" connected to the Internet and in use today, and
that by 2020 there will be over 25 billion.

Our panel of IBM experts
 will be joined by
students in these exciting topic segments:

   - *H.A.C.K. - Homes Are Compromisable by Kids! *Our homes today are
            already filled with many Internet connected technologies
from smart phones,
            web / IP cameras and baby monitors, to personal fitness monitor=
s,
            children's toys, thermostats, lighting systems and more.
The natural,
            logical question has to be asked, "How secure are these
technologies?" Our
            two youngest contributors, ages 10 and 12, (AKA
post-millennials, iGen or
            @generation) wanted to find out more about the Internet of
Things (IoT) and
            how secure it really is.  Join these two youthful
innovators as they
            describe their use of the scientific method and outlined a
hypothesis, a
            series of test cases as well as found some interesting outcomes=
 and
            observations. The goal of this segment is to inspire the
future generation
            of engineers, designers and entrepreneurs to dream of the
possibility of
            IoT - and why we must collaborate to make it more secure.
            - *Zombie Drones *
            Drones? Unmanned Aircraft? Flying Robots?!? This is an
            exciting, new and different kind of technology that
enables us to explore
            new physical spaces and see things from new perspectives.
Drone technology
            is evolving very rapidly - they are becoming lighter,
cheaper, and easier
            to use as they become more technologically advanced. Join
this fun, fast,
            and informative session to learn about drones, why they
are an important
            part of the Internet of Things family, how our guest
speaker hacked his own
            drone into a "self-flying zombie", and why security for
drones will be
            critical as we leverage this technology in the future.
            - *Cybersecurity: Help us protect our devices*
            As the number of 'connected' devices grows, the potential for
            people to gain access to these devices and the information on t=
hem
            increases as well. Help us protect our computers, mobile
phones, connected
            cars, sensors and other devices from unauthorized access
or control by
            becoming a cybersecurity researcher for a day! We will
explore a few of the
            techniques that are used to hack these devices and what we
can collectively
            do to help prevent this from occurring.
            - *Medication Dispensing in the Internet of Things*
            The use of tiny sensors will enable medication management to
            become less costly and more manageable.
            - *The Imitation Game of Tomorrowland *
            Disney Infinity Game Design Clubs provide many opportunities
            for computer science education, from basic concepts at an
elementary school
            level to Agile Development experience at a high school
level. Combining a
            cast of characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star
Wars, Disney
            Infinity provides a unique ability to interest both boys
and girls to STEM,
            with a unique virtual artistry through storytelling to spark th=
e
            imagination. This presentation will feature a gameplay
video of the first
            project from our club at the Newburgh, NY P-TECH school, Excels=
ior!
