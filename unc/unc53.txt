The Campus Y launched the Bonner Leader program in 2011, selecting 13 first=
-year students for this unique student development and community engagement=
 initiative.   The Bonner Leader program provides the opportunity to use th=

 partners on issues including after-school tutoring, affordable housing, fo=
od insecurity, youth development, community oral histories, and  community =
development.  The remainder of your work-study hours (1-2 hours/week) suppl=
ements your community work with weekly reflections and training and enrichm=
ent activities.   Because the Bonner Leaders Program is a multi-year commit=
ment, students are challenged and supported to grow and develop in their se=
rvice work, progressing from direct service to increasingly responsible and=
 meaningful positions.  View the Bonner brochure and video created by two o=
