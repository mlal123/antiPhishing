Bonjour Mangza,


Yes, that's correct- the "de" after those expressions is inv=
ariable; you don't add le/la/les. You'd say "plus de livres" and =
not "plus des livres" and "moins de liberte" and not &q=
uot;moins de la liberte." Combien de and beaucoup de are two other exa=
mples that
 work the same way.

Bonjour!
    Hello professor I just had a quick question regardin=
g comparison, I just wanted to ask and clarify that after 'plus de' or=
 'moins de' the 'de' stays as 'de' no matter what right? Not into 'des' for=
 plural or 'du' for masucline?
