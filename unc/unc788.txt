I've been seeing a number of you who have a job offer or multiple offers in
hand and have questions about what you should do next. As always, I'm happy
to meet with you, Here are some resources that can help answer some of your
questions:

*University Career Services offer policies: *

*We ask the employers who participate in on-campus recruiting to give our
students a minimum of 3 weeks to make a decision.* You can always request
an extension and mention this UCS policy, especially if you are feeling
rushed.

We also ask that *once a student verbally accepts an offer (for an
internship or full-time), that they immediately discontinue participation
in recruiting.* If other interviews are lined up, you would want to contact
those companies immediately to bow out of the interview. Continuing to look
after you have accepted an offer is called reneging and it can damage your
professional image as well as that of UNC. Please keep this in mind as you
are making offer decisions and if you have questions throughout the
process, feel free to reach out. I would be most happy to talk with you
about your decision making.

*Event Reminders for Tomorrow!!!*
