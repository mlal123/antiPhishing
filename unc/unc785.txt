Hi Mangza,

Whether you take BA or BS depends on your interests and abilities as well.
You should know that the BS requires slightly more rigorous math and
slightly higher grade levels. As for careers, if you are thinking of
becoming a hard core developer at say, Google or Microsoft, you should go
for BS. They have more job opportunities and better starting salaries.

We can talk further if you have more questions. Let me know.

Best wishes...
