Hello everyone,


I hope you all had a great weekend! I'm sending the last Undergraduate Acco=
unting Club email of the semester and my last communication as President! I=
ts been a great year working with you all and getting to know all of you. W=
hether it was at our firms events or Raleigh office trek, I loved talking w=
ith you all and learning more about accounting with you. I've been apart of=
 the club since I was a sophomore, so I'll be sad to stop attending events.=
 I know the club will be in good hands for next year, and there will be som=
e exciting changes. Akhari Brown will be President next year, so stay tuned=
 for more information from her!


I hope everyone who is attending accounting conferences will have a great t=
ime! Use those conferences as a chance to explore the firm and get to know =
its staff and culture. Hopefully, you'll receive internship offers from som=
e firms!


I'll be in the UNC MAC program next year, so please don't hesitate to reach=
 out to me with any b-school, accounting, or career questions. I hope you h=
ave a great last week of classes and your exams go well!
