Hi Mangza,

Thanks for getting in touch! However, I won't be grading your paper this
round - Emma will, so you should probably talk to her. I'm forwarding this
email to her also.

Hello Hannah! I was wondering if you could take a quick look at my
tentative thesis and current outline for my second paper and see if there's
anything I should elaborate or if something just isn't a good claim. (You
don't have to read through all the bullet points, it was just easier to
copy and paste my work sorry! the important ones are the main sub-topic
questions, those are my intended defenses for my tentative thesis)

thank you!
