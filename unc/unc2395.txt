Let this email serve as the official first CS Careers Weekly Update email
of the 2016 Fall Semester!

These emails will find their way to your inbox once a week, usually on
Thursdays. It will alert you of all CS career related activities that will
be happening the following week as well as opportunities that employers
request I send your way (But always remember the majority of opportunities
are in Careerolina!)

*One Rule: If the event has a RED RSVP link, PLEASE RSVP if you plan to
attend the event. This typically means there will be FOOD and we need an
accurate head count to give to the employer!*

So without further ado, here is your first update!
