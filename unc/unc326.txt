Folks -- This is an important clarification.  In assignment1, we said in #7=
:

Using an if-else statement, print which team won the game by how much.
There are three possible scenarios:

a.     if *uncScore* is more than *dukeScore*, print =E2=80=9CUNC won the g=
ame!=E2=80=9D
along with the *difference*.

b.     If *uncScore* is less than *dukeScore* print =E2=80=9CDuke won the g=
ame.=E2=80=9D
along with the *difference.*

c.      Otherwise, if *uncScore* is equal to *dukeScore* print =E2=80=9CIt =
was a
tie.=E2=80=9D  You do not need to print difference.



And then in the grading rubric, we said:
*15 points *Your program contains the three if-statements

Sorry for the confusion this has created. We should have written the rubric
as:
*15 points *Your program checks for the three scenarios in #7.  How many if
statements or if-else you use to do this is not being counted. You simply
need to check for and act upon each of the three scenarios. That's it.

Thanks.
