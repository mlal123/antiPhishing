Hi everyone,

We are excited about an upcoming event in the department!

The Computer Science Department is hosting a *Middle School/High School
Open House on Saturday, October 3rd from 1-4pm.*

We have *more than 750 students & their families* from across the state
registered to attend!  With so many people expected to come, *we still
really in need of help with volunteers and demos for the event.  *Demos can
include projects you have worked on outside of class or at a Hackathon that
can be demonstrated and explained at a middle or high school level.  Many
of the high schoolers attending are prospective UNC students and are
excited to talk to current students about the undergraduate CS
experience.  This
is a great opportunity to show your work or fulfill volunteer hours.

*We will provide food at 12:15, before the event starts, to anyone
volunteering or demoing.*

*Please sign up to volunteer here .*
*Please sign up to demo here .*

Thank you!
