In addition to some paid hourly LAships, starting Fall 2017, the department
will be offering LAships as part of a 3-credit graded course called
=E2=80=9CEffective Peer Teaching in CS=E2=80=9D. This course will be co-tau=
ght with Tessa
Nichols and Ketan Mayer-Patel and will cover a variety of topics related to
effective technical communication, active teaching techniques, and explore
ways in which we can more effectively teach computer science in the
department. Enrollment in the course is by permission and requires that you
have an LA position.

The course is currently listed as COMP 290 and is scheduled for Tu/Th 2-3:1=
5.
Students enrolled in the course will be asked to spend 10-hours / week as
an LA as a practicum for the course. We are in the process of getting a
permanent course number for the course approved by the college and
anticipate that the course will be approved to carry the Experiential
Education (EE) general education tag.

You will only be able to take the class once.  Taking the course does not
guarantee that you will be hired as an LA in later semesters but some
faculty may require it or give preference based on it.
