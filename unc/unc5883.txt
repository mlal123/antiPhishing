Dear Class,

Thanks so much for a very engaging first day of class! Just a few quick notes:

1. Instructions for accessing the e-book are posted to Sakai, as an announcement. The announcement now includes the prompt I would like to to use for the 'shared writing' due 8/31.

2. Lecture slides from today's course are uploaded to Sakai --> Resources.

Please let me know if you need anything else!

See you on Thursday,

Dr. Eagen
