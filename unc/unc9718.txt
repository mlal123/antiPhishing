Good morning! The Graham housekeeping staff has brought this to our attenti=
on. Please send an email to residents and check the bathroom regularly to h=
opefully eliminate this problem. Remind residents that it is everyone's res=
ponsibility to keep that bathroom clean and personal trash should not be go=
ing in those trash cans. I hope this problem ceases because otherwise I wil=
l charge the entire floor a cleaning fee. Thanks!

Hi Diamond,
I hope you are well. I am sending this email about Graham. On 2nd floor the=
 trash has been ridiculous lately and most it is not kitchen trash. They ar=
e even just piling trash on the floor and trash can is already running over=
. Also on 3rd floor someone has been filling the 1st toilet to left full of=
 paper towels every day and the housekeeper in that building is very upset =
about having to clean those out of the toilet and causing the toilet to hav=
e issues. If you could please with these two situations I would appreciate =
it.  Thanks for all you do and enjoy the rest of your day.
