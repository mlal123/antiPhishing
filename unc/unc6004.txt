ne,  The teams have been formed and the roster is located in the res=
ources tab on sakai. Make sure you check out your group number before class=
 tomorrow and come prepared to find and sit with your team based on the map=
 available at the start of class. Lower group numbers will be closer up fro=
nt and higher group numbers towards the back.   In addition, if=
 you formed your own team, it may be helpful to meet up outside of the clas=
s and come in together. Remember, we don't have much extra space, so don't =
leave gaps between groups tomorrow when you come to class.   Se=
e you in the morning!  MHM Fall2017 Grou=
