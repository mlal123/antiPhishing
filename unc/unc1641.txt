From: Jay Smith (jaysmith) - jaysmith@email.unc.eduFolks:  T=
his week we get back to the more typical kind of course reading--a "pr=
imary" document from the early seventeenth century, one that tackles t=
he issue of gender differences in early-modern Europe (the book takes place=
 in Venice, where the author lived.)  Note the page numbers assigned--=
you are not reading the whole book. But since the style is quite different =
from the Joel Harrington book, and you might find it hard to sink your teet=
h into at first, I'm going to give you a few study questions to guide you:<=
/p>     1.  How persuasive is the argument of this book=
?  Why?  2.  The editor=E2=80=99s introduction addresses t=
he issue of the =E2=80=9Cseriousness=E2=80=9D of this and other proto-femin=
ist treatises of the period.  What do you think?  Is this dialogu=
e a =E2=80=9Cserious=E2=80=9D one or not?  Why?  3.  What =
are the key arguments against the institution of marriage (presented in thi=
s book, that is)?   4.  When Fonte has the characters talk=
 about historical examples of =E2=80=9Cgood=E2=80=9D women toward the end o=
f the book, do you find that strategy effective or not?    =
 Also--don't forget that we'll have a short quiz in class today. =
