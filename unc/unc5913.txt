From: Megan Eagen (galileo) - galileo@email.unc.eduDear Class,  Thanks so much for another great meeting. As I mentioned on Tuesday, I'll be sharing music for this class through Spotify Free. This playlist features recordings set in a variety of meter signatures, both simple and compound. I'll use selections from this list to review simple and compound meters on Tuesday, Aug 29, but we won't get through all of them. If you're looking for an opportunity to practice, I hope you will find this useful.  You're welcome to contact me or one of the TAs if you are struggling with identifying a meter. We're here to help! Best,  Dr. Eagen ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "MUSC143.001.FA17" site.
