Hi all -

You will shortly be receiving an email from Castle Branch/Certified
Background for a background check that is required for your volunteer work
with Ignite CS.  The email will have a link in it - please click on the
link and follow the instructions.  I've attached a sample email so you know
what to look for.  Please complete the background check as soon as possible
as the link will expire by the end of next week (1/13).  Also, please don't
hesitate to let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks,

Beth
