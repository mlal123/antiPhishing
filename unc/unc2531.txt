*Looking to have your resume looked over before the career fair?*
Emily Ellis from Deutsche Bank (and an old colleague of mine) will be in
the lower lobby from 10am-2pm giving resume and job search tips one-on-one.
It's ideal that you have a hard copy but if you can't make that work, an
electronic version will do.

First come, first serve!
