Hi  Scholars-


I will be presenting  a  Professional Networking workshop and reception, at=
 4:15 (to 6 pm) on Monday, November 14th in Toy Lounge on the 4th floor of =
Dey Hall.

The program will begin with a brief workshop covering just about all aspect=
s of how to network in a professional setting. After the workshop, we will =
have a practice session/reception with student-friendly faculty and staff, =
during which you can put your skills into practice. Snacks will be served.

If you have previously attended a networking workshop and just wish to come=
 for the reception at 5pm, you may do so. However, even if you plan to only=
 come to the reception, you must register in advance.

I hope you will plan to come, but I also want to remind you to honor your c=
ommitment once you take a slot. (There are only 40 slots available.)

You may sign up at this site: http://etiquette.careerdimensionsnc.com/begin=

(Do not be confused by the message you will see about signing up for a Cove=
nant program if you are not a Covenant Scholars. This is still the site to =
use to register .)


Dress is business casual. (No shorts, jeans, sneakers, t-shirts, or sandals=
