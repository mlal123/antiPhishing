If you didn't see Lydia's latest Slack message, please read the following:


Happy New Year! You should have received an email from Beth Mayo Tuesday morning regarding background checks, as well as an email through CastleBranch for you to create an account through which you’ll provide some information for them to run the background
 check. Please complete this ASAP as it is time sensitive. Once you’ve completed all the items in the portal please either send Lydia a message on slack or shoot her an email so we can keep track of which have been turned in. Thanks guys! Can’t
 wait to see you all when we get back!



Best,
