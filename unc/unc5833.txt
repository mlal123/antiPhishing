I'm looking forward to working with you all this year. My goals for you are
to:

1. Get paid
2. Learn something
3. Make the world a bit better

I'd like to meet with you all regularly, we'll have to figure out a time.
I'd also like to start a intro to web development group so we can get your
bootstrapped to begin learning and working on projects.

If you are a Carolina Covenant student please let me know. I'm a mentor.
