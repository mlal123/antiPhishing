 Will be held on Friday, April 20 from 3:30=7 in SN 011.  If you have been
doing research during the past year (for example as part of a research
group or as an undergraduate research assistant), we encourage you to
participate.  If you are interested, you will be giving a 15 minute
presentation intended for a general computer science audience (faculty and
students).

All I need is your name, talk title, a short bio (content at your
discretion), and an abstract.  If you are interested, please send me the
information through this form  as
soon as possible.  I will put the information into a google doc that you
will be able to review and update as needed.

Thanks,
Diane
