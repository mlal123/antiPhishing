You can access all 6 tests and keys in your WA list as you prepare for the final exam.  I would recommend taking, on paper, the other 2 retakes you did not take and self-grade them by clicking on View Key.

Please complete the Math 130 course evaluation on or before Wed, April 27.

Wed, April 27 - Day 2 for the review for the final exam.
We will continue going over the Fall 2014 final exam and answer any questions you have.  You will get more out of the review if you have completed, or at least attempted, the questions from the 2014 final before we discuss the questions in class.
Copies of 5 old final exams can be found on WA at the bottom of the links list.

The MHC will be open during finals week.  Please check the door (PH 365) to see when help is available.

If you have 3 finals within 24 hours or a direct conflict, you may get an exam excuse from the Dean of your college.  The only way to take the make up is to have an official exam excuse or be on the infirmary list.  If you take the make-up exam, take your exam excuse and a photo ID to the testing site, and arrive 15 minutes early.  Please notify me ASAP if you will be taking the make-up exam for the room assignment.

The earliest grades will be available on ConnectCarolina will be Friday, May 6.  I will post your final exam score on WA and send an email to let you know that they are available.

To take Math 231, you need a grade of C- or better in Math 130.

Clerical error is the only reason allowed for grade changes after grades have been submitted.  There is no extra credit in this course.
