Hi Scholars,

Welcome Back from Spring Break.

I will be conducting a networking session, called Professional Networking, =
at 4:15 (to 6 pm) on Monday, April 3rd, in Toy Lounge on the 4th floor of D=
ey Hall. The program will begin with a brief workshop covering just about a=
ll aspects of how to network in a professional setting. After the workshop,=
 we will have a practice session/reception with student-friendly faculty an=
d staff during which you can put your skills into practice.

Past Scholars have found this workshop to be extremely useful in terms of a=
pplying for jobs and internships and in developing their networking skills,=
 so I encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity.

If you have attended another networking workshop and wish to come just for =
the reception, you may do so, but please do sign up so we will know how man=
y students to expect.  The reception will start at 5pm. Light refreshments =
will be served.

I hope you will plan to come, but I also want to remind you to honor your c=
ommitment once you take a slot (there are only 40 slots available).  Each g=
roup of scholars may sign up at this site: http://etiquette.careerdimension=
snc.com/begin.htm.    Dress is business casual. (No shorts, jeans, sneakers=
, t-shirts, or sandals.)

I hope to see you on April 3rd!

Please contact me if you have questions.
