From: Logan Tatham (ltatham) - ltatham@live.unc.eduHello class,=
  It's been brought to my attention that the practice test question I ga=
ve you was a bit too hard, so I'm changing one minor detail and sending it =
out here.     1. Let R be the region between the graphs =
of y=3Dsin(x) and y=3D0 between x=3D0 and x=3Dpi/2 (here is the cha=
nge- only to pi/2, not to pi).  a. (5 points). Set up two distin=
ct integrals that will give the volume of the surface obtained when R is ro=
tated around the line x=3D-1.  b. (5 points). Evaluate one of the in=
tegrals in part a. Be sure to simplify!     Again, it is=
 optional, but if you get it to me tomorrow, I can grade it over the weeken=
d as if it were a test question so that you get an idea of how my grading i=
