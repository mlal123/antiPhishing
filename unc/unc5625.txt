 unfortunately we will lose access to the old system, which includes any do=
cuments you may have stored there.

Please log into your Careerolina account immediately and download any impor=
tant documents that you may keep there, especially if that is the only save=
d version of the document.  This system will be completely unavailable to b=
oth students and staff after June 30th.  =20

We are excited to soon tell you about the launch of our new platform.  We t=
hink you=E2=80=99re going to love it.  So, watch for more information soon!

Thanks and have a great summer.
