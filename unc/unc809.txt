Folks,

As I mentioned in class yesterday, here is the first half of assignment 4.
In this part, you'll be tasked with implementing a Color class and an Image
class. We'll use these classes as a basis for implementing some
Instagram-like image filters in the final part of the assignment.

As this is the last assignment of the year, please note that this will be a
demanding assignment.  So, get started early and ask questions!  As you
know, a large group of TAs are eager to help you with your questions and
concerns. Most of the object-oriented programming concepts we've talked
about are put to use in this assignment, as well as 2D arrays, and nested
for loops, too.

This part of the assignment is due next Tuesday, 11/17, at 11:55pm. There's
a decent likelihood the submission process for this will be modified from
assignments past. I'll send out final submission instructions by end
of day Friday.
Hence this is not on Sakai yet.

Have fun!!!  And start working on this now! :)
