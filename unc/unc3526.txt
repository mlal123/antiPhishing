The peer-to-peer learning group for sport analytics will have its first meeting this year on this Thursday, Nov. 17 at Kenan-Flagler (McColl 2350) from 5:00 - 6:00 p.m.  This group was formed two years ago by Joe Zappa, a doctoral candidate in Statistics, after being motivated by his attendance at the first Basketball Analytics Summit (www.bas.unc.edu). This opportunity is a fun way to learn how to apply math, statistics, and data analysis in sports with your peers!  The group is led by doctoral candidate, Nathan Frank, and MBA candidate, Chi Nwogu. Projects are real world problems and open to all levels -- beginners to advanced. We have been blessed to work with MLB and NBA teams in the past.  If you want to get involved in and possibly seek a career in sport analytics... join Z-Stat! Tell a friend.  Questions? chijioge.nwogu@gmail.com  Dr. Stroman  This program is sponsored by the Center of Sport Business.
