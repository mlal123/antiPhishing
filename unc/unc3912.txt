Greetings, my friends.
Happy 2017.

Earlier this evening I talked with a former Lehigh teammate.
A fellow who I had not been in touch with for more than 40 years.
Dave Kruppa from Perth Amboy, NJ....
Lost both his legs in an accident many years ago.
I NEVER heard anyone so up and so appreciative to be alive.
I learned Dave never graduated from Lehigh because of a drinking problem.
His wife of 20 years left him.
Dave earned his master's degree in a wheelchair.
And is now out in Bodega Bay in northern Cali on the Pacific Ocean.
It had to be one of the most inspiring conversations of my life.
Wow.
I literally was covered with goose flesh.
If you haven't already, please do your final assignment.
Call someone from your past.

Forgive my delay in responding to the complaints about final grades.
There were only about 200!
I've been up in Pennsylvania pretty much since your exam with my 90-year ol=
d mother.
She came home from the hospital on Thursday.
My sister is with her presently.
I'll answer about a dozen emails a day until I've responded to everyone.
That should take ~ three weeks.
So please be patient and thanks for your understanding.
I am only the scorekeeper.
My goal is to try to be somewhere between fair and generous.

A colleague of mine (Jeff Hoopes) asked me to pass on the following....
In the event you are looking for another course in the spring.
Jeff is young and fun and it looks like a good course.

Subject: Death and Taxes

As certain as death and taxes is the fact that most classes that talk about=
 business, taxes will basically be ignored.  Despite being one of the bigge=
st cash outflows for any company, the biggest expense on the income stateme=
nt, and related to one of the biggest assets on the balance sheet, most bus=
iness school classes generally ignore taxes.  Why?  Frankly, it is because =
most business school students simply can=E2=80=99t handle the excitement of=
 talking so much about what is well-known to be an exciting topic--taxes. =
=20

I am teaching a new class here in the undergraduate program at Kenan-Flagle=
r, Taxes and Business Strategy, and am looking for students who can handle =
the excitement of my class.  In this class, I focus on how taxes affect man=
y corporate and individual decisions.  I cover topics such as how taxes aff=
ect financing, operating, public relations, and M&A behavior.  I am looking=
 for the following kinds of students to take my class:

1.       Students interested in keeping more of their cash, and their compa=
nies=E2=80=99 cash, as opposed to sending it off to the IRS

2.       Students interested in understanding how companies maximize after-=
tax shareholder value

3.       Students who want to understand all the news articles they read th=
at talk about crazy tax planning strategies of companies (what is an invers=
ion, and, should your company do one?)

4.       Students who want to understand how the market values tax related =
behavior, and, how to consider tax issues in valuing a company

5.       Future CEOs, CFOs, Investment Bankers, Analysts, Consultants, and =
Brand Managers

This class will not focus on tax compliance=E2=80=94we won=E2=80=99t be fil=
ing out tax returns or memorizing the section numbers from the Infernal Rev=
enue Code.  Rather, we will be talking about how taxes affect businesses, a=
nd, what businesses try to do to minimize their tax obligations.  We will a=
lso talk about how taxes affect personal decisions=E2=80=94how taxes should=
 affect your selection of pension plans, retirement options, etc.  The clas=
s requires no tax background.  I would love to have you in my class. =20

There are two sections offered, both on Monday and Wednesday, one at 8:00 A=
M, and one at 3:30 PM.  The course numbers are BUSI590-029 and BUSI590-030.=
  I look forward to seeing you in class!

Cheers,
