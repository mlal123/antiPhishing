Hey Ann, my name is Mangza. Unfortunately I wasn't able to make the stud=
y abroad seminar last week. I will be taking part in the Burch Silicon Vall=
ey Program (next semester) and I was wondering would the money I've receive=
d as a Covenant will transfer over
 to the study abroad program? I think the total cost was something like 15,=
000 and more for the program (I'll get the exact number for you, I just can=
't find it right now) and I've received additional scholarships (The Shufor=
d Award and the Crawford Award,
 both 1000 each). Is there any steps I need to take for this whole process?=
