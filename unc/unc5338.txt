*DevOps and Network Research and Infrastructure Internship | RENCI
| Deadline April 22nd*
RENCI is an academic research institution affiliated with the University of
North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. We develop and deploy cyberinfrastructure that enables
data-intensive research
and data-driven problem solving in academia, business and government.
Because we are a
research institute, projects can be molded to the interest of the student
intern as long as it
remains within the general scope of our research interests. Summer interns
work closely with
researchers and faculty to investigate a self-contained problem, produce
prototypes, develop
simulations to conduct experiments and ultimately publish results in
recognized scientific
venues. Below are some examples of the specific projects that are available
this summer.
*Project 1: *Mesos to deploy containers on the Wide Area Network
The summer intern will evaluate various aspects of big data applications on
today=E2=80=99s most
popular resource management system (Apache Mesos) including network and
compute
performance. The research will be driven by benchmarks and scientific use
cases provided apriori. The experiments will be conducted both on
campus-based test beds and public clouds
(NSFClouds and the ExoGENI test bed). Hands-on experience with cloud
computing and open
source technologies is preferred.
*Project 2:* Multi-Cloud container scheduling on the Wide Area Network
The mapping of cloud resources in forms of containers to fulfill customer
requests is a
challenging and well known NP-complete problem. In this project, a summer
intern will
investigate the mapping and scheduling of containers in multi-Cloud
deployments supported by
today=E2=80=99s most popular resource management system (Apache Mesos). The
experiments will be
conducted on both on campus-based test beds and public clouds (NSFClouds
and ExoGENI
testbed). Hands-on experience with cloud computing and open source
technologies as well as
an interest in developing scheduling algorithms and simulation frameworks
is preferred.
*Who should apply:* Graduate students and upper-level undergrads interested
in networking
research, software development, data science, collaborative technologies,
and related fields.
Students must be in good standing at UNC-Chapel Hill or another UNC system
campus.
Students interested please send resume to Claris Castillo at
claris@renci.org by April 22, 2017.
