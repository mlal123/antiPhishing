 Hi all -

Please take a moment to log into TIM and approve your timecard for *the
previous pay period* that ended yesterday, Sunday February 18th.  *You have
until 5 pm today* to approve your timecard for the previous pay period.

Please make sure you are in the previous pay period before you approve - if
you approve the current pay period, your approval cannot be removed so we
will have to manually enter your times for you for the remainder of the pay
period (i.e. the next two weeks).  Just double-check before you hit "approve
".

Thanks!  As always let me know if you have questions!
