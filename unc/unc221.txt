*Upcoming Events:*
*Reminder about employer events: *As a rule of thumb, if an employer is
bringing FOOD to an evening session, an RSVP is required.* I will include a
link to RSVP in RED in this email when it is required for a certain event.*
Please pay attention to this as it assists our employers in knowing how
much food should be ordered. Additionally, if you RSVP, please be sure to
show up. It's a good professional practice, makes UNC look good, and is
just common courtesy. THANK YOU!

*Morph*, a local startup that manages delivery drivers in the community to
source out to restaurants and restaurant delivery services like Tar Heel
Takeout, is growing quickly and hiring engineers for full time, part time,
and contract based work. We're looking for full stack web developers and
iOS/Android app developers. Work experience is preferred, though not
necessary. Compensation is a negotiable hourly or per-contract sum, and
free breakfasts are a perk of working with a guy who loves eggs benedict.
If you're interested in learning more, please shoot me an *email at
adriel@choosemorph.com *. Please include a resume
and a list of relevant course work. Even if you are just curious to learn
about Morph, feel free to contact me! At worst, you've won a cup of coffee
and some good conversation. Also visit our website (www.ChooseMorph.com)
and check out our iPhone app (Morph Delivery)


*Square* will be on campus September 10-11 and is recruiting for multiple
internships and full-time opportunities in engineering! Please view these
openings on Careerolina

and
drop your resume *before August 31*.
