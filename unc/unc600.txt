These look adequately concise to me, and I like that you’ve been=
 as specific as possible here. Of course, for a conclusions section, you=
217;ll want to distill these a bit into some overarching claims, but I thin=
k what you’ve got here is at an appropriate
 level for a methods section.

hallenge, and time spent in preparation for classes.
