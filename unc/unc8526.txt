Apologize for sending this to all majors but I don't have any reliable way
of reaching out to just juniors.  If you are a junior and still looking for
an internship, this is a wonderful opportunity.  Please submit the your
application now.  The deadline is March 2.  Feel free to contact me if you
have any questions.
