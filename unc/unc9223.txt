Hi everyone,



Have you ever thought how science can be turned into a performance?



I am excited to announce that I will be co-teaching a Maymester course
through a new summer school initiative to integrate the arts into the
sciences. *Dancing Science *will be offered as EXSS 191.01M/290.01M for 3
credits. You can fulfill the Visual and Performing Arts Gen Ed requirements
in only one month! This interdisciplinary course will survey scientific
theories from biology, physics, and geology by embodying abstract concepts
through dance practice. The instructor team consists of Heather Tatreau
(Dance, Exercise and Sport Science) who is coordinating the course plus
UNC-CH science professors Amy Gladfelter (Biology), Laura Moore (Geological
Sciences) and Daphne Klotsa (Applied Physical Sciences). Students will
study scientific concepts related to each professor=E2=80=99s research find=
ings and
modes of inquiry and bring these concepts to life by using dance movement
and performance structures. We will work toward a final class performance
to be presented to 5th graders in the Chapel Hill Public Schools as well as
design movement-based structures so these young students can truly embody
the sciences. UNC students of all backgrounds will have an opportunity to
be investigators, educators, and performers through this course!



If you are interested =E2=80=93 please go ahead and register for EXSS 191 [=
to
fulfill the Visual and Performing Arts (VP) Gen Ed requirement]. If you
have already taken EXSS 191, you should register for EXSS 290 to receive
credit towards your degree. Please hurry because registration for Maymester
is almost over!



Please help me spread the word about this unique opportunity by posting the
attached flyer in your departments and emailing it to your students and
colleagues. If this course is successful, we will eventually be able to
offer it during the regular academic year.



Thank you so much for your support!

Best,
