Dear UNC Computer Science students,

It is with mixed emotions that I announce my final days at UNC Chapel Hill.

It has been the highlight of my career to work with such an amazing group
of students. When I accepted the role of Senior Assistant Director of
Careers in CS three years ago, I had no idea what I was in for or how much
you all would brighten my days. Some of you may have heard me telling
employers that working with UNC Computer Science students has been such a
pleasure because you all are so smart, humble, and appreciative. I've never
felt more appreciated for what I do day-to-day than I have felt working
with you.

So it goes without saying that I will miss my days at UNC and especially
those I spent in Sitterson Hall with some of the best students I've ever
had the pleasure of working with. Keep crushing it like you do and stay
humble while still realizing your talent.

We are working on a transition plan and for the time being, Jeff Sackaroff
 will serve as the Computer Science student point
of contact for career related assistance until further notice. he will be
located on the 2nd floor of Hanes Hall.

Thank you for allowing me to work alongside you and best of luck with your
career ambitions!

-Jade
