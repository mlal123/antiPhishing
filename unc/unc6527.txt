We have our first build tomorrow! We are working with Habitat for Humanity =
and we are either working on a porch or roof project. Here's what you need =
to know if you signed up:


	Clothing: it's imperative that you wear closed toe shoes. Habitat=
 is not as strict about the outfit, but we strongly recommend an ASP o=
utfit (jeans/long pants-not leggings, and a t-shirt, hat if you want)
	It's a good idea to bring some water too!
	We will be meeting at the Davis ATMs tomorrow at 8 AM. I know it's early, but it'll be worth it. Rides will be provided for=
 everyone who signed up, but please just be on time!
