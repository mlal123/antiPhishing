Justin Sawon is trying to get a program off the ground in Costa Rica this
summer. It is an advanced math class, so we're trying to see if there are
any students outside of Math that might be interested and have the
pre-reqs. If you know of students that might fit this, please pass along.
Thanks.

Dear Kelly,


It was good to see you today! Below is the notice that we sent out to math
majors. If you know of some students who might be interested, please share
this information with them. Maybe there are some who were hoping to go to
Costa Rica for the Math and Biology program, but would be eligible for this
instead? The deadline is real soon, this Wednesday; since we already
extended the deadline twice I think Study Abroad would like to make a final
decision about the program then.


Thanks,

SENT ON BEHALF OF PROFESSOR JUSTIN SAWON:

Dear Math/Spanish Students,

In summer 2018 I will be leading a study abroad program in Costa Rica. This
will be a great opportunity to satisfy both major and gen-ed requirements
while spending time in an exotic foreign location! The program will pair a
math course (I will teach MATH381 Discrete Math) with a Spanish course
(SPAN203 or 204, taught by a local instructor). The prerequisite for
MATH381 is MATH232, and the prerequisite for SPAN203 is two semesters of
Spanish. The dates will be* Thursday 24th May (arrival) to Thursday 5th
July (departure)*, six weeks. For more information and to apply please
visit the webpage:

ViewProgram&Program_ID=10351



Note: We are really close to having enough applicants to run this program,
so we have extended the application deadline to *28th February*. *If you
apply now, the program will be able to run and the other participants will
all owe you a huge favor! Also, I have a federal grant that will partially
support this program - the cost to you should be at least $1000 less than
on the budget sheet:*

*

*Finally, I promise to make MATH381 more fun than usual!* *So apply now -
you won't regret it!*


Feel free to contact me (sawon@email.unc.edu) if you have any questions.



Yours sincerely,

Justin Sawon

Associate Professor of Mathematics
