Fidelity has about 10 more spots to sit with their Leap Alums to help
rebuild donated computers with their partner Kramden Institute. They have
spots in both shifts still available, and they are looking to get a few
more Tar Heels.

UNC CS is Fidelity's *number one* site for college recruiting, so this
would be a good way to get to know them. Their campus is fantastic!
