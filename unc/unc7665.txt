I was asked to put up solutions to some of the later in-class exercises. Do=
ing so is a great deal of work, work that I must admit is not justified for=
 those who failed to do the exercises in class (Class attendance was REQUIR=
ED.). But I did do a half-way job of solutions for the linear programming a=
nd least squares exercises, and I have posted that.  =A0  =A0Stephen Pizer
