              We tried to call you but your voicemail box has not been set up. We have been experiencing delays in receiving parts from Lenovo for most models computers. They are aware of the issue and we are trying to work with them to get parts as soon as possible. 

In the meantime, our techs have escalated the request for parts to Lenovo and we hope this results in receiving them more quickly but we have no further timeframe to be able to give you on how long it will be before the machine will be repaired.  

We apologize for any inconvenience and will keep you updated as more information is received.
Thank you for your patience.

DO NOT reply to this email, as it is sent from a notification-only system that cannot accept incoming email.

Thank you,
