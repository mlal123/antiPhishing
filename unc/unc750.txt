*GENWORTH Tech Talk- **USB Attack to Decrypt Wi-Fi Communications**: *@
5:30pm in SN011
The term =E2=80=9CBad USB=E2=80=9D has gotten some much needed press in las=
t few months.
There have been talks that have identified the risks that are caused by the
inherent trust between the OS and any device attached by USB. I found in my
research that most of the available payloads for the USB rubber ducky would
be stopped by common enterprise security solutions. I then set out to
create a new exploit that would force the victim to trust my
Man-In-The-Middle access point. After my payload is deployed, all Wi-Fi
communications will be readable, including usernames, passwords and
authentication cookies. The attack will work without the need of elevating
privileges, which makes it ideal for corporate environments.
