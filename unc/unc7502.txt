I have opened up seats in COMP 401 but it appears to take some time for
Connect Carolina to notice.  By the end of the day, there will be seats
available in the lecture and the 11:15 and 12:20 recitations.  I need to
balance out some of the other recitation sections and will be sending out a
request for some students to move.  If you are in a section other than
those two and would prefer one of them, feel free to get ahead of the curve
and send me a note as to which you prefer.  Please remember to send me your
PID and the section that you are currently in.
