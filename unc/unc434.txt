On Wednesday, September 30 at 8:00 a.m., the secondary password for the
UNCCampus VPN group will be changed. The new password is available at
http://help.unc.edu/help/vpn-installation-and-clients/. No action is
required until September 30, at which point the new password will need to
be entered at login.



Users logged into the VPN during the password change process will not be
interrupted. At their next login, they will be required to enter the new
password.



If you use a different VPN group, you will not need to make any change.
