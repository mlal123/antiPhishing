From: Hannah Cross (hannahe) - hannahe@live.unc.eduHi guys!  I started my Google Doc study guide for Exam 2! I have mostly everything except what we're going to cover in class tomorrow - which I'll add sometime Wednesday or Thursday. I hope this helps!  https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B112VJtAtEheQm5pZHBOeFZPeUE  Happy studying!
