Folks,

This is a time of a lot of departmental events and refreshments.  I've been
asked to remind everyone to please honor notes about for whom the
refreshments are intended.  Events like dissertation defenses are
significant events for the student defending and we want to honor them and
their guests,

Thanks,
Diane
