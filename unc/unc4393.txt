multiple emails!


*GymNOW*, a mobile app aimed to disrupt the fitness industry, is looking to
bring on some team members. Using Major League Baseball players and a bad
ass sales team, we have customers lined up and waiting.

 Our app and web interface is 90% complete, but we need your help to clean
up our code and get this thing rolling. We could literally be making money
tomorrow if the app were ready.

needs assistance in the following three areas to speed up our launch
timetable.
