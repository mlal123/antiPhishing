Hello UNC Students!

Splash UNC is an educational enrichment program that lets intellectually
curious high school students explore new subjects in classes taught by
students of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Splash
students get a taste of college by spending a day on the UNC-Chapel Hill
campus and have the opportunity to discover new interests in short, fun
classes about anything from neuroscience to origami. Splash UNC hosted 80
students at its first program in Spring 2015. At its most recent program,
Splash UNC hosted more than 1200 students!!

The ultimate goal of Splash UNC is to impart students with a love of
learning in a stress free, dynamic, and fun atmosphere. The program aims to
expand the academic horizons of high school students through fun classes
that emphasize the passion and enthusiasm of our student teachers. We hope
to encourage young adults from North Carolina and beyond to explore their
interests and engage their curiosities, and in doing so, develop a genuine
love of learning. We are strong believers that the pursuit of knowledge can
be contagious and that our student teachers can make a genuine difference
in the lives of our Splash students.

We are currently looking for student teachers, *both* graduate and
undergraduate students, that are passionate and want to share their
enthusiasm to hundreds of high school students. Student teachers can create
as many or as few classes as they wish to teach. ****For graduate students,
this is a great opportunity to present your ongoing research projects to
excited high school students! They can teach a class on *absolutely* anything,
and some examples can be found on our website here: www.splashunc.com. Teacher
registration closes *Monday, February 19 at 11:59pm*, and Splash Day
is Saturday,
April 14, 2018! Students can register to teach here: www.splashunc.com. On
behalf of the entire Splash team, thank you so much for your time and we
hope to see your passions on Splash Day!

Sincerely,
Ryan Huang
