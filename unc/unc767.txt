Ah, Halloween has passed and computer science courses are filling up.  This
year the problem is in courses above 426.  If you can't get on a waiting
list for a course you want, please submit this google form
.

Meanwhile, a few things to know:

   - There are two 590 courses that have seats available.
   - If you are in the BA program, remember that you can take two elective
   courses outside of the department and the web site includes the list of
   pre-approved classes.
   - If you have not yet taken 283, 455, or 550, they still have seats
   available.
   - If you are a sophomore or freshman, we have reserved capacity in most
   of the early courses and they should be available when you get to register.
   - If you need help, our advisers still have hours.  The calendar is at
   the bottom of the main undergraduate programs page.
