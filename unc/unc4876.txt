Good Evening Mangza!
 
My name is Maurice Grier and I would like to express my greatest appreciation for the continued support and belief in
 my campaign’s core message of L.O.V.E. I want to remind you that the runoff election for Student Body President is today. I am a finalist in the run-off election.
 
When it comes time to vote, I implore you to consider putting L.O.V.E. in office. My platform is based on four pillars
 that include Listening, Observing, Valuing, and Embracing others. Through these actions, I want us to create a culture that will have a lasting impact on this campus. It’s time to change of how we interact with one another.
 
It’s time for our student body to create a united front to present the issues we share. If you believe in spreading LOVE,
 please consider voting for me. If you have not considered voting for a candidate yet, I would be deeply grateful for your support this Friday. Voting is open at 12:01am tonight and ends at 8 pm Friday (3/24/17).
 
VOTE MAURICE HERE!
 
Thank you for your support!
 
Always with LOVE,
