Hi all -

Just a few reminders as we wind down the semester and our work study
students.  The last day a work study student may work is *Friday, May 6th*,
assuming you have not used up all your hours at that point.  If anyone
needs to know exactly where they are in regards to how many hours you have
left, please send me an email or drop by my office and I'll be happy to
help you.  Please also remember to approve your time card after you have
worked your last shift.

Thanks so much, and have a great summer!


Beth
