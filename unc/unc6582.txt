Hello all CS majors.
 
This email actually probably applies mainly to those of you in your first three years.
 
I wanted to invite you all to come this Thursday at 5 pm to Murray Hall G202 to hear
representatives from the US Nuclear Navy speak on career opportunities after graduation.
No matter what you think your plans are for your lives post-graduation, I strongly recommend
you come at least get the info on this opportunity.
 
Here’s the amazing thing about these positions with the Navy.  You start getting paid by the Navy
as soon as you are accepted into the position, and that can be as early as by the end of your soph year.
From then ‘til graduation, you make a bit over $40,000 per year while in school at UNC plus
all your insurance, health benefits, housing allowance, etc.  That’s right …almost $100,000 in your pocket
by the time you graduate.
It’s an absolutely amazing opportunity that I’d be failing you if I didn’t share…
 
UNC has had at least 5 students (maybe 6) over the past 4 years accepted into this program…. two of whom
graduated last year (one chem major and one math major I think).  One will be in attendance this Thursday.
 
Here’s where you can get more info…
https://nupocaccessions.blogspot.com/
https://www.navy.com/careers/nuclear-power.html
 
The positions you can get accepted into include submarine and aircraft carrier nuclear officers, nuclear power school instructor positions, naval reactors engineer positions,
 as well as nuclear power training unit instructors.    We’ve had at least one student get into each of these programs over the past 6 years.
No,… you don’t have to be in combat type job (sub/carrier);  you get to choose which one you are interested in.
 
Please come hear the details if you can.  It’s just an info session, but they do provide free (no obligation) info trips to their sub bases (Charleston?) for those who
 think they may be interested but are not sure.
 
I strongly encourage you to attend if you can so you know all your options.    (especially…to help pay for college…and make money too while here).
 
Let me know if questions.
 
Regards,
Todd Austell
