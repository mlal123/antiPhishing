From: Logan Tatham (ltatham) - ltatham@live.unc.eduClass,  I just wanted to send a reminder to everyone about the review tomorrow. It will be from 10-12 in the usual classroom. Please come with questions! I plan on going through a quick list of things we've done, but the review won't be very effective unless you have questions.  Thanks!
