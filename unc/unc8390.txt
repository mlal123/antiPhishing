John Morrison, who currently teaches at North Carolina School of Science
and Math is our next Professor of the Practice candidate.  He will be
speaking at *4 pm this Wednesday in SN011.  *Note that this is a different
time than the other candidates.

His talk will be on  Event Handling in JavaScript.  It will address the
general topic of events, and explore events in both the desktop and on
phones.

I am also looking for students who would like to meet with John after the
talk.  You do need to be able to attend the talk.  The meeting will run
from 5-5:45, followed by a 15 minute debrief with me.  If you are
interested in meeting, please fill in this google form
.

Thanks,
Diane
