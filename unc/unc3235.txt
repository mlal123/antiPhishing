Hello Mangza,
One of the benefits of being an upperclass r=
esident here at Carolina is the ability to renew your current room for next=
 year prior to room selection opening up. As you may or may not know, this =
feature is currently not operating as intended in the 2017-2018 Housing App=
lication.  Our staff is curre=
ntly working with our housing software vendor to fix this issue, and we=92l=
l let you know when the issue has been corrected so you can reserve your ro=
om for next year. 
Our hope is to have this feature back up and=
 running very soon, and in the meantime we want to reassure you that we are committe=
d to honoring your requests to return to your same room (as policies allow)=
, and no other student will have t=
he opportunity to select your room prior to room selection. 
Best,
Carolina Housing
