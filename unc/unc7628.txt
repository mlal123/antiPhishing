Hi Coffee Drinkers!

Thank you for making a new pot of coffee when you finish a pot. It is
greatly appreciated by your fellow coffee drinkers.

But. (There's always a "but" isn't there?)

Please take one moment before you leave the kitchen to ensure the coffee
pot is lined up below the drip.

For the second time this academic year, an entire pot of coffee has ended
up not in our mugs and bellies where it belongs, but on the counter, in the
drawers, down the cabinets and on the floor.

It's amazing how much liquid one pot of coffee contains. Enough to soak all
the filters in the drawer beneath the coffee maker, with enough left over
to make a small stream across the kitchen floor, ending up in a big puddle
under the refrigerator!

So, for the sake of that poor fellow coffee drinker who walks in on the
flood and feels a strong enough sense of duty to roll up their sleeves and
go through most of a roll of paper towels soaking up the great, brown
flood, please take a second to ensure your good deed of replenishing the
coffee doesn't go to waste - literally and figuratively.

Sincerely,

A Fellow Coffee Drinker
