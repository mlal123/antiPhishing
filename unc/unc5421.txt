Good afternoon wonderful volunteers!

Thank you so much for all of your help on Maze Day. We heard great comments
from the visiting children and their caretakers about their whole
experience. They had a great time at all of the engaging demos and loved
being served at lunch. We truly appreciate your help and could not have had
such a successful event without you!

If you did not get your thank you certificate and would still like it,
please stop by Gina's office (SN131) to pick it up.

Thank you!!!
