Hey Scholars!

If you haven't looked outside this morning, it is rather...wet. Not great p=
ainting weather. So, we are moving our Pumpkin Painting to Friday, October =
30th, from 4 to 5:30 on the Visitor Center's lawn!

Food, fun, and fall weather- it's a great way to spend a Friday afternoon. =
 We look forward to seeing you then!
