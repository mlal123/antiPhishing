Hello, friends!!


Can you believe it's April already?? We have less than a month left togethe=
r, which is high-key super sad... But on a happier note, that means summer =
break is coming!


However, that also means it's almost time for y'all to move out of HJ, and =
there's a lot of important information we need to give you to ensure that t=
he whole process goes smoothly for you and for us! We know it's stressful t=
o think this stuff about during exams which is why we want to go ahead and =
give you a heads up on what the expect and do!


So, our closing meeting is going to be this Thursday, April 14th at 6pm in =
the Orange Room. This is MANDATORY, so you have to be there! If you absolut=
ely cannot make it, please contact your respective RA and schedule a time t=
o meet and get this info. This is super necessary to avoid any fines, etc. =
that could be incurred! We don't wanna have to hunt you down, so please rea=
ch out if you know you won't be there.


We will be having lots of pizza from Toppers at the meeting, so bring a pla=
