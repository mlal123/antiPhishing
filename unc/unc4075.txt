Hi Mangza,

 
Thank you so much for reaching out! It was great to meet you last week.

 
Would you mind letting me know what year you are? That would help me ensure that I get you the best information.

 
Sorry I do not remember! I look forward to helping you as you consider the e-minor.

Hey Ms. Underwood, my name is Mangza, we met at 1789 last week at Carolina THINK. So I just had some few clarification questions I would like to ask. So since I have not taken Econ 125, I should
 not apply for the E-minor application this coming March? Also if I do the Silicon Valley study, which of my required courses would I be allowed to take there?  Thanks!
