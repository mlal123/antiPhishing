From: Jay Smith (jaysmith) - jaysmith@email.unc.eduHello folks:  This is just a reminder that I'm asking you to read Pico della Mirandola's 'Oration on the Dignity of Man' (1486) for tomorrow's class. You'll find the link to the document in the syllabus. Pico was one of the most gifted "intellectuals" of the 15th century, and this text captures some of the essential characteristics of the Renaissance, which we'll talk about some tomorrow. See you then.... ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "HIST158.001.SP16" site.
