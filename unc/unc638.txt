We've corrected some of the time conflicts that you've found in the spring
schedule.

   - The lab for COMP 535 has been moved from 11 on Friday to 11:30, so it
   no longer conflicts with COMP 541
   - COMP 585 has been moved from 10:10 on M W to 12:20 so that it no
   longer conflicts with COMP 541.  The 585H recitation has been moved from
   10:10 F to 1:25 F for the same reason.

If you see other problems with the schedule, please let me know ASAP.  Any
changes have to be made before registrations begin.
