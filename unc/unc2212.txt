Army Research Laboratory  Human Research & Engineering Directorate
Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland


A postdoctoral scholar position is available in the Army Research
Laboratory, Human Research & Engineering Directorate at Aberdeen Proving
Ground, MD. The applicant should have, or be scheduled to complete, a Ph.D.
in computer science, cognitive science, psychology, or a related field by
the time the employment starts. Candidates should have technical skills in
learning theory and modeling. Programming skills include: Java, Python,
ACT-R, R or related statistical programming languages. Relevant knowledge
includes how to run studies, simulations, statistical analyses, and writing=
.
The candidate must be a U.S. Citizen.


*Research **Direction:*

     The goal of the human dynamics of cybersecurity program is to measure,
analyze, and model human decision-making processes and the ability to
detect and thwart attacks as long-duration and complex cognitive
tasks. Our approach
to advance the foundational science is to look at the three-fold
integration of attacker, defender, and user into a common framework.


Applicants can propose research that addresses one or more main thrusts:

=C3=98 Cyber Cognition and Biopsychology: the development of metric approac=
hes
to quantify and predict cyber analyst performance and human-system interact=
ions
that seeks to collect, extract, and analyze large volumes of time-stamped
data to characterize high resolution behavioral, physiological, task-based,
and environmental factors influencing task performance and decision-making
of individuals and teams,


=C3=98Training Effectiveness: addresses the challenge currently facing the
maturation of cyber capable defense forces: understanding how to challenge,
assess, and rapidly develop cyber skill-sets in realistic cyber operational
environments to include our new human-in-the-loop cyber test range facility=
;


=C3=98Cyber Team Processes: focuses on capturing, understanding, and modeli=
ng
team processes and dynamics to achieve greater mission effectiveness, and


=C3=98Adversarial Dynamics: focuses on modeling and simulation to understan=
d
adversarial attacker-defender-user dynamics in the cyber domain to support
multi-agent simulation using game theory, AI, cognitive modeling, Markov
modeling, Petri nets, and related approaches.

     The selected candidate will collaboratively develop a research topic
with their ARL advisor into a five-page synopsis of the proposed research.
The selected research topic must seek to advance the human computational
sciences to support the cyber analyst, a key link in the Army's cyber
defense strategy.
