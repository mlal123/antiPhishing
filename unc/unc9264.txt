As Jen has pointed out there will be access to food in the park, however, I=
 recommend bringing some snacks (granola bars, etc.) and fluid (water, gato=
rade, etc.) to have in your tent and you will need them if you go on any hi=
kes. I recommend bringing some kind of backpack with which you can put wate=
r bottles if you do not have a Camelback or fluid bladder.


  *   Half Dome Hike

     *   17-miles roundtrip via the Mist Trail

     *   Sunrise is around 6:30AM - I recommend setting out at that time or=
 slightly earlier to make sure we are back before it gets too cold/dark, an=
d get to enjoy the sunrise

     *   (6) Sanjana, Brooke, Spencer, Wanyi, Mangza, and myself have expre=
ssed a desire to hike to the Sub Dome. We can plan more thoroughly on the b=
us ride


Here is a list of some other popular hikes/destinations in the park, many o=
f which are much shorter. There will be information desks and officials in =
the park to speak to as well. I suggest doing some research and using your =
Friday evening after arrival get into groups and plan what things sound bes=

# 1 Yosemite Valley, #2 Tunnel View Outlook and more.

No one besides Zac has indicated interest in summiting Half Dome with the c=
ables down. To be clear, doing so requires rock climbing equipment and the =
knowledge and confidence with your life and others to use it effectively. A=
lthough the cable trail up the side is not the face of the dome it is still=
 rock climbing. People die every year with the cables up.


**For Zac - Regarding Summiting Half Dome: I have found conflicting informa=
tion. Permits are required for climbing to the top of Half Dome, however, p=
ermits are not given out until the season starts on May 23. I spoke with a =
representative on the phone who claimed no one is allowed to climb Half Dom=
e during the off-season. This seems to patently contradict other informatio=
n available online. When I pointed this out she restated that you cannot pu=
rchase a permit until May 23 and to speak with park officials upon arrival.

Attached please find UNC=92s release form for Yosemite.  This is a Voluntar=
y Activity Waiver that all students must sign if you intend to hike any tra=
il at Yosemite this weekend.  Please sign and return by email to Gina and m=

rental consent.  I ask that you share this email and your plans with your p=
arents.



Departure on Friday.  Alec has scheduled the bus pick up for 10:30am.  Feel=
 free to stop for lunch or pack a lunch and drive straight.  I=92m picking =
up Bernard at 11am at SFO and driving up with him, Bob and Ellie.  You may =
beat us there.  If so, feel free to hang out in Half Dome Village until we =
arrive.



Return on Monday.  You should plan to depart by 11am Monday to avoid traffi=
c.  I have to depart with Bernard, Bob and Ellie late Sunday afternoon so B=
ernard can make his redeye home.



Heated Canvas Tents.  The tents at Half Dome Village have beds, linens, bla=

Hiking Half Dome.  I asked Alec to provide a list of everyone who intends t=
o climb Half Dome.  Please let him know your intent today.  For those who a=
re participating, I need to know that you have read these articles and have=
 the appropriate gear and experience to attempt the final ascent.  I also n=
eed to know that you will not attempt the final ascent in the event of rain=
, snow, hail or other weather and that you will agree to stop if at any poi=
nt you do not feel completely secure in your ability.  An inexperienced cli=
mber not properly harnessed could cause injury or death to those below him/=
her, even if they are properly secured.  It is real risk, and beyond the li=
ability issues, I want to ensure everyone is fully prepared.  For those who=
 would like to join but do not want to attempt the final ascent, a group ca=
n hang on the sub dome while the others ascend, or we can split into smalle=
r groups.
