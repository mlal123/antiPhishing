Hey Everyone,
 
First of all, we'd like to say thank you for deciding to participate in =
this year's UFS Investment Challenge! It was great seeing everyone at the f=
irst training seminar earlier this week, and we're excited to see the ideas=
 that people come up with.
 
Some notes before we get into details about the resourc=
es folder:

If you registered for the competition, but missed the first training se=
ssion, you will
still receive access to the resources folder (see the link=
 below). Along with the ENGAGE session that night, we understand that many =
people had conflicts and prior commitments, but appreciate the time from th=
ose who did make it out.
We covered a ton of information the other night. The purpose was t=
o introduce you all to the fundamental concepts behind making sound investm=
ent decisions, and hope you all came out of it with a better idea of how th=
ese complex processes work. Everything
 you heard about and more is in the resources folder for review and use. If you attended the session but did not register - we have your name=
s, email addresses and other information, and you are eligible to participa=
te in the competition.
The registration link is now closed, meaning new participants cann=
ot enter. We have 31 different teams (including single-person teams) in the=
 competition, for a total of 77 participants. 
For now - focus on the research approach and framing an idea, not =
creating the written report and model (if you choose to do a model).
We will cover the expectations for the written report at our next s=
ession, and will work through an example.
Some notes regarding the resources folder:

We will add things to the folder throughout the competition, so check i=
t periodically. Download things to your desktop and view them instead of vi=
ewing them in the Dropbox application/website
Some of the materials are very extensive and thorough. P=
lease don't worry about reading everything, just pick and choose what =
you think is helpful or interesting.
We've included an example report and it is incredibly detailed and=
 extensive. Don't think we want you to do that, we just added it because it=
 is an outstanding and in-depth investment report.
Following the next session, we will add the example written report=
 - plus detailed guidelines of what we would like to see in them - to the D=
ropbox folder.
