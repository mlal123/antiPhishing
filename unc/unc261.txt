Student Attorney General's Office Interest Session for Covenant Scholars

My name is Ina Kosova, the Undergraduate Student Attorney General, and I wo=
uld like to invite you to apply to UNC's Honor System.

UNC's Honor System is a 175 year old tradition at Carolina; it is responsib=
le for both preserving and enforcing the University Honor Code. The Student=
 Attorney General's Staff is one of the three branches of the Honor System;=
 on AG Staff, students serve as counsels, either defending or investigating=
 other students who have been charged with an Honor Code violation.

But the Honor System is so much more than serving as a "lawyer." It is an o=
pportunity to critically tackle the questions of Honor and Integrity, to mo=
ld the standards of conduct that you as a member of this University want to=
 be held accountable to, and to entertain, on a microcosmic level, question=
s such as what an equitable hearing should look like.

In order to learn more about the Student Attorney General's Staff, the Hono=
r System office will be hosting an open house for Carolina Covenant scholar=
s where you can come and interact with the different members of our system.=
 Please drop by Suite 103 in SASB North on Thursday, September 3, from 2pm-=
3pm or Friday, September 4, from 5pm-7pm for the Honor System Open House.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at kosova@live.unc.=
edu. The application deadline for AG Staff is W=
ednesday, September 9, at 11:59PM. Please click on this link for the applic=
