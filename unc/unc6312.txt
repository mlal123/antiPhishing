Hi,
 
There is a career development curriculum as a part of all of Honors Carolina’s internship-based study abroad programs. Given the short time frame between the application deadline and the beginning of our Spring 2018 programs, we would like
 to get all applicants started thinking about resumes and how to succeed in an interview as soon as possible.

 
This is not an indication of acceptance, but regardless, this is a great opportunity to improve both your resume and your interviewing skills. If accepted, we may contact you to schedule one-on-one time with one of the Honors career advisors
 to ensure your resume is in the best shape possible before you begin the internship process.

 
Please attend both a resume and an interview workshop. If none of these events work with your schedule, please attend one of UCS’ general workshops on the same topics.
