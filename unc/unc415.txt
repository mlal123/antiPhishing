BUSINESS ETIQUETTE TIP: WHAT IS YOUR NON-VERBAL MESSAGE?
[cid:image004.jpg@01D0F6D3.3A50CA90]
Whether you're consciously aware of it or not, every time someone sees you =
or interacts with you, they are receiving a non-verbal message from you. Co=
mmunication experts say that your spoken words convey only between 7-35% of=
 the message you are delivering.  The majority of your communication is com=
ing from the elements listed above: facial expression, tone of voice, movem=
ent, appearance, eye contact, gestures, and posture.  If you want to be see=
n as a young professional, it is important for you to attend to all of thes=
e elements. Make sure that your posture is erect (no slouched shoulders - w=
hether sitting or standing), that you aren't chewing gum, that you are maki=
ng good eye contact, and that your tone of voice, facial expressions, and b=
ody language are conveying the message you are intending.
