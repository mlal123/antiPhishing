I know that everyone is focused on finishing up the semester, but it's time
to give some thought about spring semester as well.  We will be looking for
LAs next semester.  The process for COMP 110 and 401 is separate from other
courses.  So there are 3 parts to this email:

*COMP 110 (and 101)*
COMP 101 is going to be the first half of COMP 110 next semester, so the LA
Pool will be the same for both courses.  The process and application are to
be found on the COMP 110 website .

*Courses other than 101, 110, and 401*
Faculty will select their own LAs for classes, but to simplify the process,
we collect the names of all students interested and pass those names to the
faculty members.  The courses that we are recruiting for are

   - 126 (practical web design)
   - 283 (discrete structures)
   - 380 (intro to digital culture)
   - 410 (data strucatures)
   - 411 (computer organization)
   - 455 (models of languages & computation)
   - 535 (intro to security)

If you are interested in any of these opportunities, please fill in the LA
interest form .

*COMP 401*
As the department continues to expand and explore ways to effectively use
undergraduate learning assistants (LAs) in introductory courses, the Spring
2018 COMP 401 offering will be making use of LAs more than ever. In fact,
for the first time we'll be using LAs exclusively, including leading the
recitation sections, and will not be using graduate student TAs at all. In
addition, we will be structuring the LA experience to more closely connect
LAs to students in the course as mentors and to foster community among
students within the course.

If you believe that you can contribute to making COMP 401 better than ever,
provide students starting out in the major and just learning how to program
with a positive experience, and are interested in helping develop exercises
and materials that get used in the course, please consider applying to be a
Spring 2018 COMP 401 LA.

As an LA for COMP 401, Spring 2018, you will be compensated for 10 hours /
week of effort and will be expected to:

   - Schedule and hold 4 regular 1-hour weekly meetings with cohorts of 6-7
   COMP 401 students. The purpose of these meetings is to provide dedicated
   office hour time to these groups of students, keep tabs on their progress
   in the course and any difficulties they may be having, and generally mentor
   students in the course.
   - Schedule and hold 2 hours of generally available drop-in office hours.
   These office hours will be available to all students to get programming
   assignment help as needed.
   - Attend and facilitate at least 2 of the required Friday recitations.
   The recitation times for Spring 2018 are as follows:
   - 9:00 - 9:55
      - 10:10 - 11:00
      - 11:15 - 12:05
      - 12:20 - 1:10
      - 1:25 - 2:15
      -  2:30 - 3:20
   - Attend a regular 1 hour weekly staff meeting (to be scheduled) of all
   COMP 401 LAs and Prof. Mayer-Patel. We will use this meeting time to go
   over any course issues and review the exercises for that week's recitation.
   - Spend on average 1 hour per week answering questions on Piazza,
   grading exam and assignments that can not be autograded, and other tasks
   that may come up through the semester. These activities may be heavier on
   some weeks and lighter on others.
