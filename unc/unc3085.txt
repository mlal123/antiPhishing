Good morning everyone. I hope you all had a nice weekend and are looking
forward to fall break!

I wanted to remind you that *Infusion will be back in Sitterson 011
tomorrow evening from 5:30-7pm* and will be talking to us about student's
on-line presence and best practices you should consider when using things
like GitHub, LinkedIn, personal websites, and social media in general. We
have a few seats left open so I will be taking RSVP's until 5pm tonight or
until it's full.

You must RSVP here as soon as possible if you would like to attend. It is
first come, first serve and we will be having a baked potato bar!

Most of you do not need to be reminded that if you RSVP, you need to
attend. This is a courtesy that you will take into your professional life.
