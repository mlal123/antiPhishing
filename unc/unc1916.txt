Apologize for the mass mailing but we've discovered that we were missing
some people who are graduating and don't want that to happen.  If you are
graduating and did NOT receive an invitation to graduation, PLEASE contact
Jodie (cc'ed) immediately and we will add you to the list.

Thanks,
Diane
