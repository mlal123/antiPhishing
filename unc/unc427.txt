You=92ll only need to know minor characters if they were di=
scussed in the lectures and the PowerPoints.  So, for example, we talk=
ed about the Nurse in connection with the theme of morality in
Hippolytus, and about several minor characters in the 
Odyssey in connection with xenia.  You should be=
 able to refer to them when discussing those issues.  But I won=92t be=
 asking you to identify minor characters for their own sake: only if they=
=92re important for a theme that we=92ve discussed.
  I hope this helps.


Yours,
