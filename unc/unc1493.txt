Celebrate Valentine's Day with UNC Business Essentials!  (bit.ly/12Lfiv1)

Essentials program
provides a solid foundation of the business fundamentals for students who
want 
real-world, relevant business skills to complement their chosen majors and
enhance
their career prospects.

program. The coursework provides a well-rounded set of tools that I can use
for
