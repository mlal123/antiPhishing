Regrettably, last week I shared an "opportunity" from Gradx that I recently
found out to be trying to charge students for services beyond an initial
interview. I won't go so far as calling it a scam as I don't know all of
the details of their services, but anytime someone tries to charge students
for anything, I get suspicious. Apparently, after an initial phone
interview, Gradx will try to sell you a $200 package promising a resume
review with two rounds of edits, a 45 minute chat over Skype with a coach,
& 3 job leads. It's sent to the student in a way that make it seem they
"owe" this to the company after the interview. It is NOT.

If you have had any experiences with this company that is similar or to the
contrary, please let me know.
