From: Logan Tatham (ltatham) - ltatham@live.unc.eduHello class!  One student brought to my attention that we never went over the material for the homework (11.11) due tonight. I'm cancelling that homework assignment, and you do not have to know Taylor's Inequality for the final. You should still know how to find Taylor Series and approximate alternating series as before, but don't worry about Taylor's Inequality.  Sorry if you wrecked yourself working on this assignment and then I just cancelled it.
