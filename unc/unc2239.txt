From: Logan Tatham (ltatham) - ltatham@live.unc.eduHello Class,=
  I have just finished grading the second exam and have put the grades o=

e test was a 67.9% with a standard deviation of 17.7, so it was much closer=
 to a reasonable test than the last one, but apparently still a bit too har=
d. I'll figure out a good way to curve it later and let you all know.  =
Let me know if you have any questions.  Logan    =
