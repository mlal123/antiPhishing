From: Eric Thomas (ehthomas) - ehthomas@live.unc.eduHello Budding A=
nthropologists,  I have posted a PDF of the slides from our recitati=
ons under "resources" to help you prepare for the upcoming exam. =
 A word of caution: while these should help you identify many of the k=
ey words and concepts you are expected to know, they do not contain everything that will appear on the exam (many questions are dra=
wn from readings, lectures etc.) so this should not be your only study guide.  Cheers and enjoy the weekend,  Eric ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ =
