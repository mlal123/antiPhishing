Fall enrollment begins MARCH 20 and there is an important change to COMP
523 (Software Engineering Lab)

You will notice that there are 14 recitation sections associated with COMP
523.  They each have 4 seats and registration for a section is required.
With 14 teams of 4 students, scheduling of team meetings has become a
nightmare.  We have therefore taken the pre-emptive step of creating
recitations, WHICH WILL BE YOUR TEAM MEETING TIMES WITH ME.  This means
that your *teams* are defined before the semester begins.  If you are
interested in working with friends, you all must register for the *same*
recitation period.  (Projects will be selected by teams once the semester
begins.)

Be aware that if you want to change a recitation section before the
semester begins, you should SWAP, not DROP and ADD as you may lose your
seat doing that.

Once the semester begins, the only way that you will be able to change
recitation sections is to find someone to SWAP with you.

Given these changes, I have set up a Piazza site (the class is called COMP
523 FALL 2017 but Piazza believes that it is being taught this semester)
for you to find out who is planning on taking the course.  You can register
for the Piazza site at piazza.com/unc/spring2017/523

Have a great spring break.
