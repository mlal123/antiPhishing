You will continue to be reminded via email  at 2 weeks, 1 week and 2 days prior
to your password expiration. For questions about the new Onyen password
management application, call the ITS Response Center at 919-962-HELP, or visit
help.unc.edu and search for 'Onyen Password.'

Once you change your password, it will work for another 90 days before it
expires again.  If you never  use your Onyen, then disregard this notice.

If you have any Laptop, Desktop, or handheld device which uses your old Onyen
password to automatically login or re-authenticate to services using the
AD.UNC.EDU domain (Exchange, for example), be sure to logout of those services
and login again with your new Onyen password within 10 minutes of changing it.
If you don't, and your devices continue to attempt to re-authenticate using your
old Onyen password, your AD.UNC.EDU account will be locked for 10 to 20 minutes,
just as if you repeatedly tried to login with a bad password. During that time
you will not be able to login.
