As a reminder, if you are interested in being employed by the university in
any capacity, you should be sure to bring the required documentation to
school with you.  In order to be added to the payroll, you need the
documentation indicated in the attached form (one from column A OR one each
from columns B and C).  (If you are an international student - please bring
your passport, your I-94, and your I-20.)   Also, the university only pays
through direct deposit, so you need a voided check or a letter from the
bank verifying the account.  For additional question, please contact Beth
Mayo (bethm).  [If you do get a position with us, we will be in touch to
remind you of the steps and the deadlines.]
