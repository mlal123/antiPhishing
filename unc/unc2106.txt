Hi everyone,

Thanks for the emails back letting me know you got added to the listserv. I=
'm hoping everybody was pleased with the test we got back today.

Now that class is picking up some and the material will get more difficult,=
 I wanted to email to see if there is interest in a review session before T=
est 2.=20

What I envision would be going through the concepts, and doing some problem=
s that emphasize pitfalls to avoid in a test situation (like the first L'Ho=
spital's rule example today).=20

Just email me back directly before class tomorrow and if there's interest, =
I'll coordinate something at a time that works.

-Julien
