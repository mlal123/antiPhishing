From: Jay Smith (jaysmith) - jaysmith@email.unc.eduFolks--I KNEW I was forgetting something on Wednesday; I meant to give you some time to fill out the course evals for 158 in class before we broke up. Would you PLEASE do me the favor of filling out the eval? Especially when we have a relatively small class, it's important to get everyone's input. Otherwise, it can be hard to make sense of the ratings. Please do it! ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "HIST158.001.SP16" site.
