Hey yall!


Couple of quick things for everyone to get on top of ASAP-- first of all, w=
e have the Tar Heel Classic next weekend.  Many people are playing in it, b=
ut even if you are not, you are expected to be there!  This earns us over h=
alf our budget for the following year, so if you want to be able to go to a=
ny tournaments next year, we have to run this well!  Jess and I will send o=
ut a job list/sign up sheet later, but it would be ideal if 1st year player=
s who are not in the tournament could entirely run the board/brackets.


For those of you who are in the tournament, it normally costs $65/division =
for open tournaments.  Because you are playing for free, we need your help =
beforehand!  To save us a lot of money (and to make our tournament better),=
 we want everyone who is playing to bring a snack or dessert food that coul=
d feed roughly 20.  Cookies, brownies (Not you Junessa), or anything else h=
omemade is better, but you can also just go by the store and get something.=
  We want people to love this tournament and for it to be different than al=
l the others-- that's how we get people coming back every year even though =
our courts are not great.


Finally, make sure you message me about playing the final MACRC tournament =
at UNC Feb. 24-26th.  Roster due Wednesday!


Thanks yall,
