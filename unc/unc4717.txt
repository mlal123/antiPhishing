Hey Everyone,




Thank you all so much for volunteering =
with us this semester! We really appreciate you all taking the time out of =
your busy schedules to help us introduce students from Culbreth=92s after-s=
chool program to topics in Computer
 Science. You guys did such an incredible job and we couldn=92t have pulled=
 it off without you.




As this was our inaugural igniteCS prog=
ram, we know not everything ran as smoothly as we wanted, but we really app=
reciated your patience and understanding as we figured out what worked and =
what didn=92t. 




Now that this semester=92s igniteCS ses=
sions are complete, we have just a few more things to ask of you. 





In a few days (or whenever th=
e form is available to us), we will be sending out a reminder to complete G=
oogle=92s =93Post-Program Survey=94 as well as an internal post-program sur=
vey. Survey completion is crucial for
 us to receive future sponsorship/funding from Google, so it=92s imperative=
 that you complete Google=92s survey. The internal survey will be very open=
 ended as we=92d like to gauge your thoughts/feelings/ideas about future it=
erations of the program.


 


Please reply letting us know =
if you are interested in working with this program in the future. This =
isn=92t a commitment as program semester/dates/times are still TBD, but thi=
s will allow us to stay in touch.







(Optional) Feel free to get in touch wi=
th either of us if you have ideas or feedback you=92d like to discuss more =
in depth, we=92d love to hear your suggestions on how we can improve! Our n=
ext initiatives are to grow/expand the
 program and to create a more engaging/interesting curriculum, and to do th=
