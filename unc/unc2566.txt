Hey Greg!

So I was not at practice tonight because I actually flew to Orlando tonight=
! Weekend trip to Disney with the fam. My knee is still bad and my meniscus=
 is a torn a little (still discussing surgery treatment options with my doc=
tor). That said, I still want to be a part of the team and am going to try =
and make it to as many practices as I can to watch and learn. I'll bring my=
 dues in next week for the first practice I can make it to.

Thanks for all the info!

First of all, great practice tonight!  Please come to Saturday morning and =
Sunday evening if possible! This is going to be a long email, so hang in th=

Dues

If you have not already paid dues, please bring your money in to our treasu=
rer, Ethan!  Dues are $50 for the entire year.  This pays for a team shirt =
and allows you to play in our four tournaments.


Tournament

Our first tournament is in TWO WEEKS!! This is CRAZY early, so please come =
to practice to prepare! We are allowed 16 guys and 16 girls-- I will be ask=
ing yall next week if you're able to go.  Tournament will be Friday-Sunday,=
 the 23rd-25th.


Ladders

Ladders are completed!  These are a lot of fun and are also used to decide =
which division to enter folks in for the tournaments.  You may challenge up=
 to two slots above you.  When you challenge someone, you play two games to=
 15.  If you need a tie breaker, it goes to 11.  This is the same as in our=
 tournaments.  **PLEASE LOOK AT THE LADDERS THAT ARE ATTACHED-- IF  YOU ARE=
 NOT ON THERE, IT IS BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT AT PRACTICE TONIGHT AND I NEED YO=
U TO REPLY TO THIS EMAIL WITH YOUR FULL NAME**.  Do not stress about your c=
urrent placement on the ladder--- to be entirely honest it is fairly random=
 once I got below the returning players. You have plenty of time to challen=
ge folks and let the ladder settle where it should be.


Equipment

To participate in a tournament, you will need your own gear.  I am includin=
g a couple different websites to look at.  You will want to buy a racquet, =
eye guards, and at least one glove.  If you do not know what to buy, facebo=
ok message me or text (704-467-9290).  I am more than happy to help you cho=
ose out cheaper equipment that will still be good.

Facebook

One of the main ways we communicate is on our Facebook group.  Here is the =
