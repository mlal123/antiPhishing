The Cognitive Computing Odyssey
Fall 2017 // Presented by Uncubed & IBM

Note: Travel & lodging are fully covered for accepted students.

Cognitive computing unites fields like Artificial Intelligence, machine lea=
rning, & natural language processing to "think" about data more like a huma=
n than a computer.

It treats cancer patients, personalizes education, predicts financial marke=
ts and the weather, helps governments make decisions, and rethinks retail.

This Fall, students from across the country will meet in San Francisco, Bos=
ton, Austin, and Toronto - travel & lodging fully covered - to explore the =
technologies, future, applications, and jobs of AI as part of The Cognitive=
 Computing Odyssey.

Participation is through application process, and jobs are available in bac=
k-end, server, cloud, firmware, front-end, full-stack, cognitive, automatio=
n testing, and client-facing solutions development.
