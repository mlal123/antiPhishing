From: Buck Goldstein (goldstb) - buck_goldstein@unc.eduHello  <=
p>Thanks for your diligence in attending class today. Sorry for the bad con=
nections and other issues but we did the best that we could under the circu=
mstances. I am back on Franklin Street having returned from the hotel.=
  As of now the main roads are clear.  The plan for tomorrow is t=
o meet in Graham Memorial if school is in session and if not to meet at the=
 University Hotel where most of you are staying. If classes are cal=
led off, we meet at the Hotel.  I just checked and there=
 are Ubers and Lyfts out and about.  If you need to use one to get to =
class tomorrow, we will reimburse.  If you have any special issues sur=
rounding attendance at tomorrow's class, call me at 9198837555. ----=
