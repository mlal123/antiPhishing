Dear Mangza,

 
You have been selected to participate in the Real-U Study, a UNC research study aimed to help us understand the real experiences of students at Carolina. Participants in the Real-U study complete two surveys
 and a brief lab task administered in two testing sessions, separated by two weeks, at the Center of Developmental Science located in the Top of the Hill Building in downtown Chapel Hill. The surveys will ask about a wide range of experiences unique to college
 students such as use of social media, relationships with friends and family, health behaviors and well-being, and substance use. Participants completing both testing sessions will receive $45 and have an opportunity to enter a drawing for an additional $100.
