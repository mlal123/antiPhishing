Hey professor Glotzer, so I have 2 homework assignment (the very first t=
wo) that I have 0's on and that was because I had to waitlist to get into y=
our class and I didn't want to commit the money for webassign if I hadn't g=
otten into your class but those
 homeworks were already due by the time I got into your class. Could I do t=
hem now or something?
