The department has posted a number of work study openings.  I've been told
that there were some problems with the hourly rates that were posted and we
are working to fix them.  You should check back to see if the rates have
improved, but more importantly, apply for the job regardless of the rate
and tell us if that is a problem.  You always can decline the offer.
