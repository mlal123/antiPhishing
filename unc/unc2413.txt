			Hope you had a great first week of class. For those of you who aren't fa=
miliar with it, roommate agreements are a mandatory part of living in the r=
esidence hall and they require that I sit down with you while you complete =
them for each pair of roommates on the hall. Single rooms only can ignore t=
his. 
		
			We need to have these done within a couple of weeks, so I am attaching a=
 google sheets link below for sign-ups. Please read the available t=
ime slots (not marked out black) with your roommate and pick one time slot,=
 then put both of your names and room number down in that slot. Do not pick=
 a time that has been taken by someone else. These should be strai=
ghtforward and not take much time but we do need to knock them out. Once yo=
u have a slot, I'll come to your room during that time and we'll do the agr=
eement.

			If no available times work for you or your roommate, email me please.&nb=
sp;
		
			Again, this is one of the few mandatory things we have to do, so if ever=
yone could sign up when you get a chance that would be great!
		
			Thanks,
