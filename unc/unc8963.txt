Hey Y’all, 
 
I just wanted to let you all know that tomorrow is admitted students day here at Carolina. There will be many students with their families on campus looking around, taking tours and such. Sometimes in the past, they will try and get into
 the residence halls and see a room for various reasons. This unfortunately is not allowed and they should be directed to the admissions office in Jackson Hall. They are not allowed to be roaming around the community either. Aditya and Allison, please can you
 update the OAs working the desk about this too. I do not anticipate many trying to do this, but wanted to out front in case some did try come by. Thanks.
