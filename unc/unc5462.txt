This summer we will be changing the system currently known as Careerolina t=
o an exciting new platform called Handshake.  When we make this transition,=
 unfortunately we will lose access to the old system, which includes any do=
cuments you may have stored there.

Please log into your Careerolina account and download any important documen=
ts that you may keep there, especially if that is the only saved version of=
 the document by June 30.  =20

We will be repeating this message as we get closer to the switch, and we wi=
ll also be providing additional details about the new system.  We think you=
=E2=80=99re going to love it.

Thanks and have a great summer!
