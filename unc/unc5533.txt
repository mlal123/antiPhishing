Hello from Chapel Hill!

The tuition reduction for the UNC Business Essentials (UBE)
(https://na04.mypinpointe.com/link.php?M=53497114&N=49166&L=4120&F=T)
program ends on May 31st, so time is running out to take advantage of the $500
savings* with the program.

Kenan-Flagler Business School designed UNC Business Essentials
(https://na04.mypinpointe.com/link.php?M=53497114&N=49166&L=14352&F=T)
to help non-business majors acquire a solid foundation of the business basics
without having to commit to earning a minor or major in business. Each of the
six modules takes approximately 10-12 hours to finish so that the entire program
 can be completed this summer if you spend 4-5 hours a week on it. Enroll now
and start next fall with a solid understanding of business. Please give me a
call or email me if you'd like to discuss UBE or this $500 limited time tuition
reduction. Sincerely,
