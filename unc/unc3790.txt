Hey Guys!


Hope your exams are going well so far! As we wrap up the semester just a=
 few things to keep in mind:


1. Minor training - Because we're working with minors, the university re=
quires background checks and training for all mentors. Again, if =
you have any concerns or objections about this please let us know right awa=
y! We'll be starting this process soon and
 will send out an update once the (short) minor training module i=
s available in Sakai.


2. Curriculum - So at this point we're planning on using Code Academy's =
HTML/CSS program - but that's currently being updated. Once the update goes=
 through we'll send you an email. We'd like everyone to work through some o=
f the program - even if you already
 have experience in HTML/CSS - to gain familiarity with the platform.


3. Start date - Right now we are aiming to have our first session with t=
he kids on 1/30 -- put this in your calendars!!


Finally, if you haven't logged into the 
igniteCS portal and filled out the survey, or the internal survey I sen=
t out please do!


As always, let us know if you have any questions.


Thanks guys! Good luck with exams and have a great break!
