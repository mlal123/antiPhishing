From: Dylan Glotzer (dglotzer) - dglotzer@live.unc.eduHello all,  I want to give a quick announcement to let you know of an important&n=
bsp;part of the grading policy:  If one or both midterm grad=
es are lower than the final exam grade, the smallest midterm grade will be =
replaced by the grade on the final exam.  As stated in the =
syllabus, the breakdown is the following:  HW: 20%  MT1: 20%<=
/p>  MT2: 20%  FE: 40%  Examples: If your scores are HW: 9=
0%, MT1: 83%, MT2: 60%, FE: 75%, then this policy will put your final score=
 at 79.6%. Without the adjustment, your final score would be 76.6%.  If your scores are HW: 100%, MT1: 60%, MT2: 70%, FE: 80%, then this p=
olicy will put your final score at 82%. Without the adjustment, your final =
score would be 78%.  The "curving" policy remains in effec=
t (i.e., positive-only adjustments may be made once all final scores a=
re in, but only if necessary).  ~~  If you have any questions=
 or concerns at all about this, please let me know.  Best,  D=
