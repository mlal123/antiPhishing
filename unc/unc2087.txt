Hi everyone,
 
I hope this email finds your Monday off to a great start. After a math lecture that combined gratuitous use of the word "shit" and a reference to the derivative as "the d word," how can it not be...?
 
I'm in your MATH 231 class and I thought about creating a listserv/study group that could be used to get help from one another on Webassign and potentially review for exams/final, if there is interest in that.

 
If you are interested, if you could reply to me directly before class tomorrow, I will add you to the My Limit Doesn't Exist listserv.

 
Cheers,
Julian
