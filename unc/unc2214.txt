From: Logan Tatham (ltatham) - ltatham@live.unc.eduHello class,=
  I have finally finished grading your exams! The uncurved<=
/strong> grades are in the Gradebook section of Sakai. The average gra=
de was a 56.6%. The grade distribution was actually much more bell-shaped t=
han I expected. A more in-depth breakdown is at the bottom of this email.  I will be thinking of ways to curve the exam over the next couple of=
 days. After I finished grading, I was quite a bit more happy with the perf=
ormance than I was this morning. I plan on making the average about a 75%, =
but I'm not sure how yet, but you can compare your score to the average sco=
re of 56.6% (knowing that the average will likely be curved to about a=
 75%) to get an idea for what your curved grade will be.  Also, I ke=
pt track of how many questions were left blank. On average, 1.3 questions w=
ere left blank. I recognize that it was a long exam and that the time const=
raint was...constraining. If you left 3 or more questions blank (I'm counti=
ng things like writing one line of something that doesn't make any progress=
 as blank), then I would be concerned about timing.  See you all tom=
orrow!  Logan     average: 56.6% standard dev=
