Hello Everyone,

This is a friendly reminder that we will be hosting Red Ventures for a Tech
Talk from 5:30-7 p.m. tonight in SN014. There will be free food! During the
tech talk they will walk you through how to get an exponent.js application
up and running and prove how quickly and effectively you can get into
mobile development with a cutting edge technology.

Hope to see you there,
