Quick reminder about practice tonight-- hope to see you all there.  Ladders=
 are attached-- challenge away before the end of the semester!  Hopefully w=
ill be able to go print them today as well...



Also, quick plug for our Faculty Advisor, Prof. Balaban in the Econ departm=
ent.  She is easily one of the most well known and well liked professors at=
 UNC, so take her classes if you can!  Her Econ 101 and Honors Econ 101 are=
 filled up-- but it looks like she is also mentoring for a C-Start course a=
bout corruption in sport economics.   I am including a link to the page exp=
laining what a C-Start course is (basically it is taught by a student who w=
orked with a Professor, in this case Prof. Balaban, which allows for more d=
iverse topics of courses) and a brief description of the course below.  Che=
ck it out if you have time on your Wednesday afternoons 3:30-5:30!

SPCL 400-306 Description: "Playoffs and Payoffs: The Economics of Corruptio=
n in Sports"

As sports spectators, we have felt the glory of our teams' victories and th=
e pain of last-second defeats. But often underlying these experiences is a =
world of money and corruption. Billions of dollars change hands between pla=
yers, teams, leagues, and fans. In this class, we will examine the role of =
corruption in sports, particularly through an economic lens. Students will =
learn basic economic concepts and use them to explain why cheating occurs a=
t every level of the sports industry. Classes will be discussion-based and =
centered on prominent occurrences of cheating in the modern sports world. A=
t the end of the semester, students will propose economically-sound solutio=
ns to the corruption problem. Prior economic knowledge is not necessary.
