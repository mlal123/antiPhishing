From: Logan Tatham (ltatham) - ltatham@live.unc.eduHello class,=
  Congratulations, you're all done with the first exam! I think the exam=
 ended up being more challenging than I intended. Sorry about that. I haven=
't graded them yet so I don't know what the grades are, but if the average =
is less than a 75% (I'm pretty sure that it will be), I will adjust the sco=
res so that a 75% will be the new average.  I have uploaded both the=
 exam and solutions to Sakai in the Resources tab.  Grading can take=
 a long time, but I will try to have the grades done to hand back on Friday=
. My other graduate student friends say that is very ambitious of me, but I=
 know how stressful it can be between the time you take an exam and see you=
r score, so I will try my hardest.  Please don't hate me, I'll be fa=
ir. See you tomorrow.  Logan Exam 1 Key.pdf<=
