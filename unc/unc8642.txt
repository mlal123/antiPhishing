*Building Your First Android App *

All mobile devices now a day come with a list of sophisticated sensors to
allow developers and consumers to use the device in a variety of ways.
Sensors make mobile devices more intuitive to use and make it more
productive by extending its usability in range of application areas. Androi=
d
devices support a multitude of different types of sensors that measure
motion, orientation, and various environmental conditions. In this tutorial
session, we are going to develop our first Android app, which utilizes one
specific sensor to detect rotation of the device. We will learn about the
steps to develop an app in Android Studio, the structure of an Android app,
the Android sensor framework, how to utilize the framework and how to test
the developed app.
