"Hello everyone, my name is Jonathan Liao, and I am an undergraduate s=
tudent working with CS professor Gary Bishop. We are hoping to develop=
 software to make the process of composing music easier for kids with disab=
ilities. Back in 1949, Fred Brooks (founder of the Computer Science departm=
ent at UNC) started a project with a similar goal. He hoped to develop a pr=
ogram that would take in various pieces of music and create new songs based=
 on the input. However, difficulties arose and it was never completed. Now =
that nearly 70 years have passed, Professor Gary Bishop and I believe that recent advances i=
n technology can solve the problems that plagued this project and even make=
 music composition accessible for people with disabilities.

We are currently recruiting students to join ou=
r team and carry out this project. Although not required, we are looking fo=
r students with prior experience in programming (COMP 410 & COMP 4=
11), strong mathematical skills (MATH 547), or experience in music composit=
ion. If this prospect interests you, please send me an email at&n=
bsp;jonliao@live.unc.edu and I will get back to you. Th=
anks so much for your time, and I appreciate your effort in serving people =
with disabilities!"

Super cool. Look forward to getting involved!
