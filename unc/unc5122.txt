Hey,
=20
 You can extend the homeworks that are due tomorrow by submitting an extens=
ion request on WebAssign. This only works if you ask for it between 5 pm an=
d 7 pm tomorrow (it has to be after the due date and within 2 hours of it).=
 After you ask, you should automatically get an extra 2 hours. The number o=
f requests available is also unlimited, so you can keep asking within 2 hou=
rs of the new due date to get additional 2 hours.
=20
 That being said, it's either you use this or the due date stays tomorrow 5=
 pm, because I won't grant extensions retroactively.
