I have enjoyed your blogs for week 10 and in some cases week 11.  Let's mak=
e week 11 the last required blog. After the week 11 submission concentrate =
on your final project.  You have an outline and  hopefully we have a schedu=
le by now (I haven't checked it lately) so concentrate on making the final =
project awesome.  I am traveling across the country to view it.  Make it wo=
rth the trip.  The proposed outline for the final project should be viewed =
as a suggested framework but not a rigid requirement.  If you want to come =
out of the box, great.

Could one or two of you figure out how to get lunch brought in for the two =
days.  That will give us more time to talk and will work better than a grou=
p dinner, I think. Let me know who is going to do that and if you need a cr=
edit card number to charge the lunches in advance I can give you one.

I look forward to seeing you all soon.
