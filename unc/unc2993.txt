Good morning all!

We have 3 more companies that calendars have opened in Careerolina for mock
technical interviews. Since space is limited (only 6 students per date),
I'm only allowing students to sign up for *ONE mock interview per semester
unless otherwise stated.* This means that if you are on the mock interview
calendar for another company, *you will not* sign up for one of these
interviews.

*Coding Interview Practice with Kitware: Nov 8*
*Coding Interview Practice with SAS: Nov 14 *
*Coding Interview Practice with IBM: Nov 15 *
*Coding Interview Practice with SAS: Nov 16*

*Directions to sign up:*
