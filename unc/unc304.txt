BUSINESS ETIQUETTE TIP: Honoring Commitments

[cid:image004.jpg@01D0EBDA.6F930B90]

A cardinal rule of professional etiquette is honoring the commitments that =
you make.  As a student, that translates to keeping appointments, pulling y=
our weight in a study group, showing up at programs that you've said you wo=
uld attend, and following through once you've given your word.  In other wo=
rds, "If you say you will, be sure that you do!"

One way to help ensure that you can honor a commitment is by considering it=
 carefully before you make it.

Of course there are emergency situations that may arise that, in spite of y=
our best intentions, may cause you to have to back out of a commitment.  Th=
ese should be few and far between.  Should such an emergency occur, it is i=
mportant that you give as much notice as possible to whoever is counting on=
 you and to apologize.
