Hi all,

I recently dealt with a hacking problem related to my Epic Games account
(the one we use for Unreal 4); someone stole my credit card info and was
using it to make purchases on the Google Play Store. Epic Games has
apparently been bombarded with hacking attempts due to the popularity of
Fortnite Battle Royale. Apparently the hackers can also turn off the
ability of receipts to be sent to your Gmail (pretty insecure on Google's
part).

Anyway, I'm just here to recommend any of you who have used the Epic Games
Launcher and/or Unreal 4 to change your passwords, and for those of you who
have purchased anything from the Epic Games store, double check your credit
card statements.
