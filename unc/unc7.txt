Hello Mangza Lal,
This week, we ran our first =
round of housing assignments for all First-year students who completed a co=
ntract by the priority deadline of May 15th. We are sending you =
this email because you are one of approximately 115 students who we were no=
t able to assign during this round.
Please rest assured that you=
 WILL receive a housing assig=
nment! We have several programs whose rosters have not yet been finalized, =
and as they are, many spaces will open up. We will also receive cancellatio=
ns, as some students inevitably decide not to attend for various reasons.
Please also keep in mind tha=
t is still very early in the process. We will continue to assign students a=
s spaces become available, and will do our best to assign you to your prefe=
rred hall with your confirmed roommate. You will receive an update in 2 wee=
ks regarding the status of your assignment. 
Best,
