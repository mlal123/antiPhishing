From: Megan Eagen (galileo) - galileo@email.unc.eduFolks,  I posted my lecture notes from Thursday, Aug 24 and Tuesday, Aug 29. This isn't going to be a regular thing, but I hope you'll find the material helpful, especially since we won't be covering elements as an isolated component of rock moving forward. You'll see a few slides we didn't get to -- I may allot 10-15 minutes to that material on Tuesday's class (Sept 5), but no more.  Cheers,  Dr. Eagen ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "MUSC143.001.FA17" site.
