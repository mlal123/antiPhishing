*EDUC390/790: Design of Emerging Technologies for Education*

In this class, students will engage in *hands-on workshops* to explore
*how* *emerging
technologies are designed and used to improve teaching and learning*, such
as virtual reality, augmented reality, games, simulations, robotic
cubelets, visual programming language, and Makey Makey.

Students will also engage in *design thinking processes* to develop or
redesign their own technology-enhanced learning environments, including new
apps, games, curriculum, and/or activities. Students can work on any topics
of their interest and build on their existing project (e.g., Girls Who Code
project).

If you have any questions, please feel free to email me (
khryoo@email.unc.edu).
