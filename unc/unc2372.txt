*Happy first day of classes Computer Science students!*

Most of you are familiar with this listserv that is ALL THINGS CAREER &
INTERNSHIP! If you are new to CS, let me give you a rundown of the Carolina
to Career Program  and what to expect.

1.) *My name is Jade Barricelli and I am the career coach in residence. *I'=
m
here to work with CS students to help you prepare for on-campus recruiting
(Lovingly referred to as OCR) and reach your career goals. You can come to
me with any career related question! I also work with employers and bring
them to campus so that you all can connect with them for jobs and
internships. I sit in Sitterson 121 on Tues & Wed and Hanes Hall on the
second floor (Career Services) on Mon & Thur. I'm not on campus on Fridays.
If you want to schedule an appointment while I'm in Sitterson, email me
your availability for the upcoming week. If you want to schedule while I'm
in Hanes, go to:

2.) *Resume Labs*: These intensive labs are designed to teach you
everything you need to know about writing a great resume so that you are
ready for meeting employers. We work in small groups and you will leave
with the knowledge of what is important to have on your resume and how to
communicate it on paper. These labs are by RSVP only and are held on select
Monday evenings. RSVP here!


3.) *OCR* refers to any on-campus employer activity who's goal is to
recruit students for jobs and internships. This includes Career Fairs, Tech
Talks, Info Sessions, Lobby Tables, Mock Technical Interviews, On-Campus
Interviews, and other special networking events like TechIT, CS Symposium,
and LiNCS. The best way to become aware of these events is to read my
weekly email, "Carolina to Career Weekly Update" and to check the CS
Calendar found here: https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=3Dh=

Student Union Great Hall from 11am-2pm and will feature 50+ employers
recruiting for jobs and internships for CS & IS majors. See the list of
employer's attending here.


5.) *Careerolina*  is
the Job and Internship database that our employers use to post their jobs
and internships. Become acquainted with it and check it often as new jobs
and internships are posted everyday.

6.) *Career Bytes:* These are CS specific career prep workshops. If you are
new to OCR and want to know everything there is to know about OCR, plan on
attending the first session on Sept 6th from 3:30-4:30 in SN011. You can
