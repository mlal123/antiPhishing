From: Ray Wang (raywang) - raywang@live.unc.eduHi All,  I've uploaded the attendance grades for Tuesday's class in the Gradebook, according to participation in the Poll Everywhere question. If you were present in class but received a '0' for your grade, this means your response was not successfully recorded, most likely due to failing to 'log in' to respond to the poll. I will be available at the end of class tomorrow to try to troubleshoot these issues. Given that you have three 'free' absences for the course, I would not worry too much if you did not get credit for attending Tuesday, although I highly recommend you get in touch with me so that we can give you credit for the rest of the semester.  Cheers,  Ray ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "ECON125.001.FA17" site.
