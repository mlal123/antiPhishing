Good morning everyone,

The UNC Science Expo will take place from 11 am - 4 pm on Saturday, April
22. The event includes most science departments on campus, with
informational tables lining Cameron Ave. We open our building to visitors
and usually have more than 800 people come through to see computer science
demos. With so many people coming, we need lots of demos. *If you are
available, please sign up on this Google form
*. We will provide food at 10:15
am, before the event starts, for all demoers and volunteers.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Best,
Hope
