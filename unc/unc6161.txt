nning awesome eco-friendly programs as the sustainability officer, or helpi=

See this message from our Morrison ResNET team:

Hi Morrison!



We've been seeing a lot of wi-fi networks generated by printers throughout =
Morrison, which unfortunately has the undesired effect of slowing down the =
internet speeds for many residents. With that in mind, if you have a printe=
r in your room, and see a wi-fi network with a similar name to your printer=
 (the networks will appear in the same list as eduroam and UNC-PSK), please=
 turn the network off or reach out to a Residential Computing Consultant wh=
o can do it for you. These networks are usually named something like 'Direc=
t-D2-HP Envy...', and turning the network off takes very little time, will =
still let you use your printer, and will give better internet speeds for yo=
u and everyone around you. The Residential Computing Consultants in Morriso=
n are:

Thanks for the help. Go Heels!

Thanks for everything you do to make our community great. I hope you have a=
 great day and have a smooth start to the weekend tomorrow!
