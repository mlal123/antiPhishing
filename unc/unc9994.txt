*We are recruiting participants for a research study to help us
understand how different types of information may be helpful to
people doing searches on the Internet. *

*In this study, you will be asked to use a web browser and a search system
to find information for four tasks that we will provide.  The tasks will
ask you to find information and to write a response to address the
information requested by the task.  You will create your response by typing
into an electronic document.  During the study, we will ask you to
think-aloud while you search and we will ask you some questions about your
experience.  We will make audio and screen recordings of the sessions. *

*You will receive $40.00 for participating. *

*This study takes approximately 2 hours to complete and sessions are held
in our lab on-campus in Manning Hall (next to Lenoir). *
