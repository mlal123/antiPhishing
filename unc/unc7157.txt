This is an automated message to inform you that your refund has been processed.  Please note that it may take up to 5 business days for the funds to be deposited into your account at your bank.  The amount of your refund is listed below. Sometimes financial aid payments to your account are not allowed to be applied to some of your charges.  Please check your student account in your ConnectCarolina Student Center and pay any remaining balance.

Please be aware that textbook charges will not be charged to your student account until you have picked them up, so textbook charges may not be deducted from this refund.  You can pay for textbook charges when you pick up your books or opt to bill the charges to your student account and be billed in September.
