Reminder that there will be an open house tomorrow evening.  5 pm in SN014.

It's my chance to tell you what's happening and what is new.

For newer majors, it's an opportunity to get the lay of the land.

For the more veteran majors, it's a good way to find out what is changing.

For everyone, it's a great opportunity to find out about extracurricular
activities that you might get involved in and to get any questions that you
have answered.

Hope to see you there.
