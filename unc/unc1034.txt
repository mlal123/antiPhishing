exam, you can come to my office (Phillips 413) today.  I will be here =
until 12:00.  I will also be in my office between 3:00 and 4:0=
0 pm tomorrow (Thursday) if you would like to see your exam (this =
is different from the time I listed in my last email).  Once again, =
it has been an absolute pleasure teaching you all this semester.  I wi=
