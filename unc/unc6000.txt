Hey everyone,

In case you haven't been introduced to me I'm Daniel Korn. I'm a graduate
student who acts as a mentor to all work study students that work under Dr.
Bishop and Dr. Pozefsky. Every week I prefer to meet with students in a one
on one setting to discuss ideas for your work study projects, plan out a
weekly plan, and check up on everyones progress. These meetings only take
15 minutes, and are typically pretty casual.

I'm trying something new this year, and organizing the one on ones via
doodle polls.

Even if you're project hasn't been 100% figured out yet, I'd still like to
meet with you and discuss ideas for the upcoming semster. Please let me
know if you have any questions.

Daniel Korn
