Thanks for being a part of our meetup this year and I hope to stay in to=
uch. I graduated and will be at ConsenSys Brooklyn working for Meridio, a p=
roject working towards digitalization of physical assets (i.e. Real estate)=
 to enable shared ownership models (i.e. rent-to-own).

 

If you're interested in leadership/continuing the meetup, dev resources =
for summer learning, or if you'd just like to chat, I'm reachable only at p=
leeplace@gmail.com from now on. I can also connect you with other UNC Alum =
in the blockchain space. 

 

I was also sent these job/internship openings to share- https://air=

"Enigma is a blockchain-based protocol that uses groundbreaking pri=
vacy technologies to enable scalable end-to-end decentralized applications.=
 With Enigma, “smart contracts” become “secret contracts,=
” where input data is kept hidden from nodes in the Enigma network th=
at execute code. Without this functionality to protect sensitive data, bloc=
kchains and smart contracts are either useless or not truly decentralized.<=
/p>

We believe Enigma is the missing piece to a decentralized future.
