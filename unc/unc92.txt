ordinator for Peer Mentoring & Engagement in the Center for Student Suc=
cess & Academic Counseling (CSSAC) at UNC.
		
			We at CSSAC want to help you to be successful by informing you of all th=
e amazing resources we have through our office. One of these resources is p=
eer mentoring.  CSSAC has partnered with the Carolina Covenant to prov=
ide each incoming Carolina Covenant Scholar with an upperclassman Carolina =
Covenant Scholar who serves as a mentor, friend, guide, and resource throug=
hout the year.
		
			Here is a quote from a former first-year student who participated in the=
 Covenant Peer Mentoring Program:
		
			“For me, I found that my mentor genuinely cared about me and w=
anted to help me in any way she could, even though she was extremely busy t=
hese past two semesters. Although we have not been able to meet in person, =
she is always there if I text her. She has been a great resource that I nee=
ded after I switched my major and it is because of her that I know how impo=
rtant a peer mentor is for kids, like me, who have no idea what they are do=
ing and need that extra boost/help to get through personal struggles, stres=
s, etc. Incoming Carolina Covenant Scholars more than likely will need an e=
xtra resource in addition to the other resources on campus and a peer mento=
r is a wonderful option that I am personally very grateful for.”=

		
			 
		
			We have paired you with a Covenant mentor who is extremely excited to me=
et you and will be contacting you soon.
		
			If you have any questions about the program or if you would not like to =
be paired with a mentor, please feel free to email me at werica@email.unc.edu.
