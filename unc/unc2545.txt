Good morning,
 
Usually, students will receive a refund for the health insurance if they recently waived it. However, this is a billing question that you should direct to the
 cashier’s office at cashier@unc.edu. If you provide them with your PID number, they can look into your file and determine if you will be receiving a refund.

Hello, if I enrolled in the student blue but then cancel it and waived it successfully, will I get the refund back now that I have waived it?
