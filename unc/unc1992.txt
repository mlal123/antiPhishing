From: Andrea Cooper (adcooper) - adcooper@email.unc.eduDear class,  Your papers can be picked up on the back of my office door in Carolina 127. Please let me know if you would prefer to have the paper scanned and emailed to you.  As well, for the take-home exam, it's fine if you mention a thinker more than once - the instructions were meant to convey that a thinker shouldn't be the main focus of any of the responses more than once.  Best of luck! ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "RELI79.001.SP16" site.
