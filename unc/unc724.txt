Hello Inner tube Water Polo Captains, 
 
I just wanted to update everyone on the Intramural Inner tube Water Polo playoffs that will begin on Thursday, November 5, 2015. 

 
PLAYOFF FORMAT
Playoffs will be single elimination bracket style.  Eligible teams must have averaged at least a 3.5 sportsmanship rating throughout the regular season and paid any pending forfeit fines as required.

ROSTER DEADLINE
November 6, 2015 by 5:00 pm, is the last day to finalize your team roster. No additions will be made after this date.

SEED SELECTION PROCESS
Seed selection will be held TONIGHT at 10:00 PM. If you miss your selection time, you can still log on at any time and select from the remaining seeds on the bracket until Thursday, 11/5/15 at 5:00pm, at which time I will NOT assign teams
 to a spot in the playoffs.

HOW TO SELECT A SEED
In order to select a seed, just log on IM Leagues and go to the Inner tube Water Polo page and click on your league. From this page, there will be a link about midway down the page that says "Click Here to View Playoff Brackets". Once you
 click the link to view the bracket, you can select a seed in the bracket at or after your selection time by clicking on the spot of the bracket that you would like and enter your team name in that slot. It should update automatically, so as team's select spots,
 it should appear on your bracket.

Please remember when you select your seed that it may be beneficial to look at future games and not just the first round games when determining if a specific seed fits your schedule.
