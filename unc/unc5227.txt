Greetings from Chapel Hill!

Are you looking for a way to stand out in job applications and interviews? Then
you should consider the UNC Business Essentials (UBE) program which teaches the
fundamentals of business in six online modules. And now is the ideal time to
enroll since there is a $500 reduction* in the program tuition until May 31st.

Kenan-Flagler Business School designed UNC Business Essentials to help
non-business majors acquire a solid foundation of the business basics without
having to commit to earning a minor or major in business. Each of the six
modules takes approximately 10-12 hours to finish so that the entire program can
 be completed this summer if you spend 4-5 hours a week on it. Enroll now and
start the next academic year with a solid understanding of business and renewed
confidence for interviews. Please give me a call or email me if you'd like to
discuss UBE or this $500 limited time tuition reduction. Sincerely,

Mike Cain UNC Business Essentials Program Manager ube@unc.edu / 1-866-821-9458

*UNC Business Essentials tuition will be reduced to $2,000 until May 31, 2017,
