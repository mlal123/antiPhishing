moderate skills. Since phase completion will be based on goals not time,
your mileage may vary. Specifics of the programming tasks cannot be

stipend will be paid in 3 installments of $500 each upon successful
completion of specific goal-oriented and time-based milestones. The $500
bonus will be paid upon achievement of certain =E2=80=9Cstretch goals.=E2=

retail websites like Wal-Mart and Target with Amazon's price and be able to
save all of the products that fit my price and sales rank parameters. The
program will be a web-app that can crawl through online stores (Walmart,
Target, Best Buy, Amazon, etc) and analyze prices with Amazon's price (Done
through the title, UPC's or ASIN's).  The app should run in the browser and
use a document database (MongoDB preferred).  The back-end should be
written preferably in Node JS.  Front end should be a basic dashboard style
with a modern JavaScript framework (Angular, backbone, or ember will do).
The app should be configured for cloud deployment. This is a single project
that should be completed in a relatively short time. If it is successful it
could lead to more projects throughout the year as more websites are
added. Please
submit your resume. Include a paragraph on how your skills and experience
would be a fit for this project. Feel free to email me with any questions.
