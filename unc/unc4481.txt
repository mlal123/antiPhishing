and approaches test-taking.

pation: Depending on which of three Study Condition Groups you are=
 assigned, you may earn up to $100 in addition to the benefits of academic =
coaching with a certified academic coach at the learning center. Academic c=
oaching has been linked to academic success in college students. By partici=

ls, and may learn effective and research-based strategies for reading, stud=
ying, and test-taking. You may also learn how to set an achieve goals, and =
