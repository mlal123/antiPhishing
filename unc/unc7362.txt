Hello from UNC Study Abroad,

I hope all is well as you prepare for your upcoming semester abroad! We are currently registering spring 2018 and calendar year 2018 students for the study abroad placeholder course. This course is typically at least 12 credit hours and keeps you enrolled as a full time student while you are abroad.

In order to complete your registration in a timely manner we need your help!

Your student account must not have any holds or flags such as Advisor Appointment flags, parking tickets, library fines, prior balances, or fees. If you have a hold for any reason please clear it as soon as possible!
You must not be registered for any on-campus classes for the term abroad, including regular classes, online classes, or independent study classes.

If you are still waiting on an admissions decision from your host university or program you can temporarily register in on campus classes for spring 2018. Once you have been officially accepted by the host university, please drop ALL BUT ONE of your on-campus classes and email Ashley Steed asteed@email.unc.edu.
If you have received your acceptance to your host university or program and are registered in on campus classes for spring 2018, please drop ALL BUT ONE of your courses now and email Ashley Steed at asteed@email.unc.edu.
Please DO NOT contact the Registrar`s Office to drop all of your courses or to cancel your registration. This un-enrolls you from UNC!

If you are not registered for on campus courses and do not have any holds your registration will be completed shortly. No action is needed from you at this time.

Thank you for your cooperation!
