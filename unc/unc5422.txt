From: Valerie Lambert (vlambert) - vlambert@email.unc.eduDear Stude=
nts,  I have submitted requests for grade changes and cannot predict=
 when they will take effect.  They need to be approved by the chair of=
 the department and the dean.  The good news is that more than half of=
 you -- 55 students -- have no change in grade.  Of those whose grades=
 were changed, exactly half will experience a higher grade, and exactl=
y half, a lower one.  Apologies for the consternation this will cause =
those of you who will have your grade lowered.  I have instructed th=
e TAs to go ahead and enter the final exam grades and the recitation partic=
ipation grades for their students into the sakai gradebook so that all=
 of you will have more information about your grades.  Note that the s=
akai gradebook grades do not reflect the extra point added to you=
r final grade that those of you earned who attended the Chief Dugan talk. &=
nbsp;I added this extra-credit point to the final grades of all s=
tudents who attended the talk and who followed the instructions for how to =
gain credit for attending.  Apologies again for this very unfortunat=
e problem with the ANTH 102 grades.    Professor Lambert  <=
