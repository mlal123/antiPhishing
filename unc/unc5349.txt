Hi Mangza -

I just wanted to let you know that as of the pay period that ended on
Sunday, 4/30 you have *0.04* work study hours left available for this
spring.

*Please do not work any additional work study hours this semester unless
explicitly asked to by Dr. Bishop.*

Please don't hesitate to ask any questions or check in with me about your
balance.  You can also track your progress on the Google spreadsheet that
was shared with you at the beginning of the fall semester.

Thanks,


Beth
