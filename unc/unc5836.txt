R Open Labs with Chelsea Estancona

From R Open Labs at UNC
Whether you are a beginner or an expert, you are welcome to join us and develop your skills!
R Open labs are (mostly) unstructured workshops designed to help you learn R. Each week, brief instructions will be provided, followed by time to
practice, work together, ask questions, and get help. Participants can join the lab any time during the session and are welcome to work on unrelated
projects.
Our goal is to connect researchers and foster a community for R users on campus. For more information, visit our website:
