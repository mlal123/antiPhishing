As a Computer Science major (or minor), you are qualified to have a user ac=
count on the Computer Science Department systems, and I just set up the acc=
ount. This account will allow you to log in to public machines in Sitterson=
 Hall and the Fred Brooks Computer Science Building, access web pages limit=
ed to department users, and use some specific CS Department servers that mi=
ght be needed for your coursework in upper level courses. In addition, it i=
ncludes an account on the department's Google Apps domain, allowing you to =
use the department's Google calendar, groups, google drive and various othe=
r apps. Note, however, that email receipt is not enabled for your departmen=
t Google account; mail to your_login@cs.unc.edu is forwarded to your campus account. You have been added to the majors@c=
s.unc.edu careers@cs.unc.edu email group.

To activate your account see: http://cs.unc.edu/help-article/new-accounts/

In addition, as a major you are eligible for a Sitterson/Brooks building ac=
cess card, which will let you into the building after hours. You can get yo=
ur access card the first 2 weeks of class by stopping by the front desk in =
