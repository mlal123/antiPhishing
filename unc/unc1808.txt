Have some time this weekend?  Consider volunteering for the UNC Science Expo
 this Saturday.

The expo runs 10-3 and is a signature event of the North Carolina Science
Festival.  This event usually brings about 800-900 people, many of them
young students.  We want to show these young students the great things they
can do and make with computer science.  Many of these visitors want to know
about the undergraduate experience at UNC and in the Computer Science
department and enjoy talking to current undergraduate students about their
classes and projects.

The link to sign up to volunteer is here


Thanks,
