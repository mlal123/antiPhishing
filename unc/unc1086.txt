From: Hayden Giuliani (haydeng) - haydeng@live.unc.eduHello class!  <=
span style=3D"font-family: calibri;">Wel=
come to LFIT! My name is Hayden Giuliani and I will be your instr=
uctor for LFIT Weight Training.  There=
 are a few announcements I would like to send your way.  First,=
 all LFIT classes will meet in Fetzer Gym A (FG 110) for the first day of c=
lass. You will hear a brief overview of what to expect in LFIT this semeste=
r, and then we will break out into our group so I can introduce myself. We =
will not be doing any physical activity on the first day of class, so no ne=
ed to dress in athletic attire.  Second, this course carries =
a separate fee and is to be paid in the Department of Exercise and Sport Sc=
ience and NOT to the Cashier=E2=80=99s office.  The fee is $43.00 and =
will cover your "on-line" class materials, lab fees, and lab manu=
al.  The $43.00 will be due on the first day of class and I will colle=
ct the fee during class time. The easiest way to pay is online with yo=
ur credit card at:  https://apps.research.unc=
.edu/events/index.cfm?event=3Devents.browseEvents&searchEventCriteria=

09965068 =
(you are looking for LFIT).  FAILURE TO PAY WILL=
 RESULT IN A HOLD ON YOUR GRADE.  Additionally, =
;you should receive two emails if payment was accepted, an event confirmati=
on and a payment notification. On the first day, please provide me with an =
email confirmation email, or a printed receipt, in order to get your lab ma=
nual!  If you are on Scholarship or Financial Aid, you will need to contact t=
he Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid to find out how to use that m=
oney to pay this fee to us directly.  Generally, students use the refu=
nd that they receive after their tuition and fees have been paid.   If you drop your class on or before March 1st, 2016 yo=
u may receive a refund.  You will need to e-mail&=
nbsp;jcanders@ema=
il.unc.edu to facilitate=
 this process.  We will not be checking to see who has dropped.  =
Requests after this date will not be honored and your money will not be car=
ried over to another semester.  You will have to repay the fee if you =
decide to take the course at a later date.   =
Thanks and I =
