Hey Everyone,




Thank you all so much for volunteering with us =
this semester! We really appreciate you all taking the time out of your bus=

As this was our inaugural igniteCS program, we =
know not everything ran as smoothly as we wanted, but we really appreciated=
 your patience and understanding as we figured out what worked and what did=
n=92t. 




Now that this semester=92s igniteCS sessions ar=

In a few days (=
or whenever the form is available to us), we will be sending out a reminder=
 to complete Google=92s =93Post-Program Survey=94 as well as an internal po=
st-program survey. Survey completion is crucial
 for us to receive future sponsorship/funding from Google, so it=92s impera=
tive that you complete Google=92s survey. The internal survey will be very =
open ended as we=92d like to gauge your thoughts/feelings/ideas about futur=
e iterations of the program.


 



Please reply le=
tting us know if you are interested in working with this program in the fut=
ure. This isn=92t a commitment as program semester/dates/times are stil=
l TBD, but this will allow us to stay in touch. 






(Optional) Feel free to get in touch with eithe=
r of us if you have ideas or feedback you=92d like to discuss more in depth=
, we=92d love to hear your suggestions on how we can improve! Our next init=
iatives are to grow/expand the program and
 to create a more engaging/interesting curriculum, and to do that we=92ll n=
