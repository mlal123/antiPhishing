Short Course Spotlight: Visual Design for Surveys: A Hands-on ApproachThis course focuses on how and why words=
, numbers, symbols and graphics independently and jointly influence answers=
 to questions in Internet and paper surveys. It begins with theoretical bac=
kground on why and how the visual aspects of questions are interpreted by r=
espondents and guide their reding and comprehension of meaning. Application=
s of the theory and research to designing individual person and establishme=
nt surveys in ways that improve their usability for respondents will be pro=
vided.=20
 The course includes a discussion of the substantial=
 implications these ideas have for the design of mixed-mode surveys in whic=
h some respondents are asked to report aurally (e.g. telephone) and others =
are asked to complete visually communicated (web or mail) survey questions.=
 The substantial visual design challenges researchers are now facing with d=
esigning questions for smartphones will be discussed as part of the mixed-m=
ode design issues that must be addressed in many surveys.=20
 The Instructor: This course will be taught by Don A. Dillman, Regents Pr=
ofessor in the Departments of Sociology and the Social and Economic Science=
