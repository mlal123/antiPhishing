Hey!
I'm one of your residents and I'm very excited for this upcoming year. A couple questions about move in. I'm a member of the marching band and band camp starts tomorrow! Because of work I wasn't able to move up these last couple days so I'm planning to move up bright and early tomorrow morning. I just want to make sure people will be there to sign out my key and everything. I'll have to move in around 7am in order to make it in time for band camp. 

Thank you,
