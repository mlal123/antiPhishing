We have a suspicion that Sakai may have a problem saving/submitting a quiz =
properly when the site is open on multiple windows or tabs. =A0We're not su=

 single Sakai window open. =A0Therefore, if you think you may want to=A0loo=
k at one of the PowerPoint slide sets during the quizzes, please download t=
hem=A0to your laptop before you come to class.  =A0
