There have been a number of incidents in the last couple of weeks where we
have found doors propped open or locks disabled.  This is a serious
violation of department policy and, more importantly, a *major security
concern*.  Propped open doors mean that anyone can get through them and
that endangers both property and personal safety.  DO NOT DO IT.

If you see doors propped open, close them!  If you need to let someone in,
you *must* do it in person.

If we find individuals propping doors open or disabling locks, we will
revoke your access card.
