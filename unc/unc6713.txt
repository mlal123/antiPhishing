Thanks for your message, Mangza.  There’s nothing else for you to do; your budget will be revised to reflect your new budget, and your study abroad scholarships
 will be added to your package once we get the final confirmation from the Study Abroad Office.
 
All the best,

Hello my name is Mangza. I will be taking part in the Burch Silicon Valley Program (next semester) and I am a Carolina Covenant member and  I was wondering would the money I've received as a Covenant
 will transfer over to the study abroad program? I think the total cost was something like 15,000 and more for the program (I'll get the exact number for you, I just can't find it right now) and I've received additional scholarships (The Shuford Award and the
 Crawford Award, both 1000 each). are there any steps I need to take for this whole process?
