Thank you for emailing the University Cashier's Office.  We’ll formally respond to your e-mail within one business day but, in the interim, here are
 answers to some frequently asked questions.
 
Payment Plan - If you need to sign up for a payment plan, you do that
 with Tuition Management Systems.  They can be reached at 1-800-722-4867 or you can enroll online at
https://unc.afford.com. 
The deadline to sign up is August 16th. 
 
I have my own health insurance or I waived out of the health insurance last year, why is it appearing on my statement?
You must waive the health insurance each year/semester.  This can be done online here:

We can only give detailed account information to students and their authorized users. 
 Students should follow the instructions on the link below to set up an authorized user.

Why did I receive a billing statement? 

Our system issues a billing statement if you had activity on your student account since the last billing period.  You may not have a payment
 due for that billing period.  To view the statement, click on the links in your billing statement email.  If the eBill doesn’t generate into a new window, be sure you have disabled pop up blockers.
