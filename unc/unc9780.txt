Quick follow-up re: the email below with the LinkedIn offer for UBP student=
s.
LinkedIn just informed me that they will provide you with two, back-to-back=
 6-month complimentary subscriptions rather than one single 12-month offer.=
  So, please proceed with accepting the 6-month offer now.
While I am sure that you will find this Premium subscription to be helpful,=
 please accept my apologies for any confusion this might have caused.
