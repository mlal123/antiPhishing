Does 3:30 still work for everyone tomorrow? We need to have this meeting for the new people and go over some basic stuff and see where everyone is at.


For location I'd like to use one of the conference rooms on the second floor. It would be nice to be able to project someone's laptop onto the wall for everyone to see easily.
