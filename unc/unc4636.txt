The Odum Institute Data Archive, along with partners=
 at Dryad, has been awarded a $184,45=
0 one-year grant from the Robert Wo=
od Johnson Foundation under the Foundation's Open-Access Research progr=
am. The project, "Increasing the Value of Open Access Through Open Data Publicat=
ion Policies," will seek to identify the most effective and=
 efficient methods for implementing robust data policies that incorporate d=
ata review and verification processes. Using an analysis of journal policies as well as survey and interviews of=
 journal editors, referees, and authors, the project will develop a model f=
or robust data policy implementation that includes recommendations on the c=
ontent and presentation of policies that support authors' understanding of =
policy expectations, frameworks for developing guidance documentation to en=
able authors to comply with the policy, and suggestions for manuscript revi=
ew workflow modifications that address the challenges of data policy implem=
entation.This evidence-based model wi=
ll provide clear and actionable guidance that may encourage journals to imp=
lement robust data policies that support the discoverability, accessibility=
, and usability of data underlying published articles.The project will be led by PIs Thu-Mai Christian, Odum Ins=
titute Assistant Director for Archives, and Professor Todd Vision, Associat=
e Professor of Biology and Adjunct Associate Professor in the School of Inf=

Short Course Spotlight: Applied Spatial Regression Analysis=20
 This short course provides an introduction to the f=
ield of spatial regression modeling. When analyzing data aggregated to geog=
raphic areas (e.g., census data for counties), a fresh set of issues arise =
that are not present in traditional non-spatial data analyses. These issues=
 need to be recognized and accounted for when properly specifying regressio=
n models using attributes that are linked to geographic location.=20
 The topics covered in two after=

  	Why standard regression models generally fail=
 when analyzing spatial data
    Defining and understanding "spatial aut=
ocorrelation"
    Causes of spatial autocorrelation
