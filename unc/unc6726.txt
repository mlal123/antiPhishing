From: Ray Wang (raywang) - raywang@live.unc.eduHi All,  Dave and I will be holding office hours this Friday from 10 AM to 2 PM in the Entrepreneurship suite (first floor Gardner), for those of you that want to look at your exam as well as the solutions. We will generally not be changing any grades unless there's a clear error in the scantron, but we will keep track of any questions that are giving students trouble.  Best,  Ray ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "ECON125.001.FA17" site.
