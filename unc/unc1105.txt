Greetings, Students!
 
I hope you are all doing well, and that you=92re eag=
erly anticipating the start of classes tomorrow.  I=92m writing to you=
 because the English department is still in the process of determining how =
to best serve students=92 needs this Spring. 
 To that end, we have created a new class =96 ENGL 121, British Literature,=
 19th and Early 20th Century.  This course is appropriate for any leve=
l, but is especially fitting for students who love the study of literature =
and are considering English as a major
 or second major.  ENGL 121 not only can meet any one of three general=
 education requirements (LA - Literary Arts, CI - Communication Intensive, =
and NA - North Atlantic World),  but it also fulfills a core requireme=
nt in the major.  Scheduling information and
 the course description are below.  I hope this information is helpful=
 to you as you continue to fine-tune your Spring plans!
