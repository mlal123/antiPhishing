Each year the computer science department recognizes an undergraduate
learning assistant as the LA of the Year.  You have taken at least one
class this past year that has used an LA.  Please vote for your favorite LA
and tell us why you think they are worthy of the award.  It's a simple form
.  Votes will be accepted through
Wednesday, May 9.

Thanks,
