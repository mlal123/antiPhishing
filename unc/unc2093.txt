We have an idea for an app that we've been working on the past few months,
market research is over and we're ready to move forward on development. We
are looking for a student who has prior experience coding apps in the iOS
platform. It should be a simple project and Kenan-Flagler is very
interested in coming on-board once we have a prototype so this could be an
awesome opportunity.

 The work would last roughly a month with a deadline of July for the first
prototype. Work will be done virtually with calls every week for updates /
feedback and then in-person in office space at 1789 in later June.



Pay will vary from $15 / hour to a possible bonus upon project completion.



Interested students should send a resume and short blurb to
zmbrown@kenan-Flagler.unc.edu  and expect to
follow up with a brief conversation to go over the project in more depth.



Students will have a chance to be part of a start up partnering with the
Kenan-Flagler Business School developing an app that could reach thousands
of users by next year.
