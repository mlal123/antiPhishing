Hello Mangza,












I hope you enjoyed winter break and that your spring semester classes ar=
e going well! I'm emailing you to describe some exciting opportun=
ities we are hosting at the Undergraduate Accounting Club this semester, sp=
ecifically our accounting club
Firm Trek on February 17th (February 24th is=
 our firm trek back-up day if something goes amiss). 


On January 25th we will be hosting our first accounting meeting o=
f the semester with RSM, a widely-respected accounting firm that is the 6th=
 largest global audit, tax and consulting business worldwide. Our second ac=
counting meeting will take place
 on February 1st with Becker CPA test prep. They will be bringing by=
 a representative to answer any accounting and test prep questions you may =
have. Free food and drinks will be present at both events!


The most exciting opportunity for this semester is our Firm Trek event! =
For our firm trek we will be traveling to a number of accounting firm offic=
es in Raleigh to meet and network with their staff. This is a great opportu=
nity to gain a better understanding
 of what a job in accounting would look like and I highly encourage you to =
attend. As of now I know we will be going to Deloitte and EY, and we are st=
ill working on confirming this date with Grant Thornton and DHG. We will approximately
 meet up around 9am at the Kenan-Flagler parking deck on February 17th=
 and will arrive back on campus =
at 5pm. You may either carpool with our leadership team or drive yourself t=
o these locations.


Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, I am happy to he=
lp you in any way I can. Have a great second week of classes!
