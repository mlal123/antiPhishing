Hi,

Thank you for your interest in Tar Heel Reader. You can register yourself
using the Register link on the Login page. In order to register you will
need to know the secret registration code. The secret is "Literacy!"
without the quotation marks. Remember to use capital L and include the
exclamation point. Feel free to tell the secret to others but please don't
post it somewhere that bad spammers will find it.

If you are planning to have your students write, it is best to get one
account for yourself and have your students use it. Multiple users can use
the same id at the same time. However, if you plan to use the site as a
writing tool for students, please be certain that all books are edited
before publishing them to the site. If it is important to keep the book
exactly as it was produced by the child, please leave it in draft form and
enjoy it yourselves. Only completed, edited books should be published to
the Tar Heel Reader site.

Go forth and make books!
