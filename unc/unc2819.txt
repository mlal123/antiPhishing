Hello from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

At the beginning of each academic year, I always reach out to all of our UNC under-
graduate students with information about UNC's online business training program 
UNC Business Essentials (UBE). This non-degree program was designed by top-ranked
UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School faculty members to provide non-business majors* 
with a firm understanding of the basics of marketing, economics and finance, financial
accounting, operations, and communication.

In this video, we interviewed several individuals who recently finished the program -
most while completing their own degree at UNC. They provide realistic views of the 
program's flexibility, and they also touch on how UBE has helped them in their interviews,
 internships, and jobs.

UNC Business Essentials consists of six business modules which each take approximately
10-12 hours to finish so you can complete the entire program in four months by 
spending 4-5 hours a week on it. Online tutors are available 24/7 through interactive
discussion boards to ensure that everyone gains a clear understanding of the course
material.

I hope you'll consider this program if you are interested in learning the business
fundamentals. Please give me a call or email me if you'd like to discuss UNC Business
Essentials.
