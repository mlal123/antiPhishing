So, that playlist in general has a shit ton of useful stuff in regards to a=
nimation,javascript,html,css and other stuff. Collision detection starts at=
 episode 14 or so. It's titled 'collision'. I recommend watching most of th=
e videos before it though because the information builds on top of each oth=
er and he explains stuff really well. Not just on what the title of the vid=
eo is but how the methods and functions he's using are doing and how they w=
ork. He uses Window.requestAnimationFrame(); to do animation and update val=
ues. Maybe look up how closures work in JavaScript. It deals with the scope=
 of variables in functions.
