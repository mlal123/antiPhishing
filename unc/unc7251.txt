From: Megan Eagen (galileo) - galileo@email.unc.eduFolks,  I received reports that some of the quiz grades for chapters #5-7 didn't transfer correctly to Sakai. I think the issue arose from my downloading those grades during a major update. I've cross-checked all marks for chapter quizzes #5-7, and added marks for the optional chapter quiz #8. If a quiz grade is still showing up incorrectly for you, please email a screenshot of the correct score.  Hope everyone is staying warm this weekend! Best,  Dr. E-J ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "MUSC143.001.FA17" site.
