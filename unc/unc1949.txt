We sent out an earlier ballot for TA of the year a while back and we have
had a great response.  However, we have had an interesting problem:  a
significant portion of the votes have been for LAs (a.k.a., undergrad
TAs).  We have therefore decided that we should have 2 awards: one for an
LA and one for a graduate TA.

We are proceeding well on the LA front, but we are looking for more
feedback on graduate TAs.  We therefore have collected the names of the TAs
that have already been nominated and ask you to vote for the TA who has
made the most difference to your computer science education this year.
This award was established to recognize that our upper-level courses are
significantly enhanced by the contribution that our graduate TAs.  Please
let us know who has made a difference to you!

Voting ends on May 2.  So, here's the ballot
!

Thanks,
Diane
