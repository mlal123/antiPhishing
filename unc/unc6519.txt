From: Megan Eagen (galileo) - galileo@email.unc.eduFolks,  A=
 few students asked if I would be willing to compile a concise study guide =
to go along with the listening materials. (These, by the way, can be access=
ed through the Spotify Free: Unit I Playlist).  The attached guide summarizes key points per track. The inform=
ation is not comprehensive - I encourage everyone to spend a little extra t=
ime with the tracks that receive special attention in your reading, and are=
 accompanied by Listening Guides. The relevant song titles are underlined i=
n my list.  While some questions - in particular those concerning da=
tes - will be multiple choice, you may be asked to provide the names of son=
gwriters, soloists, tracks, and genres.  Finally, the exam will not =
include questions about Elvis or rockabilly. Unit II will begin with a disc=
ussion of Garofalo/Waksman, section 4.6.  Please feel free to contac=
t me with questions or concerns. Happy Listening!  Dr. Eagen-Jones             Musc143.001-Unit01Playlist.pdf--------------=
