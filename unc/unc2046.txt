This would be a project with the Institute of Global Health and Infectious
Diseases, working with the communications director Morag MacLachlan. It is
beginning as soon as possible, and she's looking for a coder who can work
with an existing website theme code within Wordpress. The site is
globalhealth.unc.edu. Interested students should email Morag at
morag_maclachlan@med.unc.edu with their resume and portfolio.
