Get your practice on!!!

We have some mock coding interview slots open for Feb 8th and 9th with
nCino and Kitware. Several engineers from both companies have graciously
volunteered their time to help our CS students perfect their technical
interviewing skills! Sign up for an hour-long one-on-one practice interview
if you want a safe space to practice with someone who knows the process!

Spots fill fast! Use Careerolina to sign up and please remember that since
space is limited, only one interview per student. Log into Careerolina
 and search for
"Coding Interview Practice"

Also, February 7th at 5:30pm in Sitterson 011, we will be hosting a panel
discussion on interviewing best practices with professionals from Infusion,
Google, nCino, Kitware, and RTI. Bring your questions and your hunger as we
will have pizza!
