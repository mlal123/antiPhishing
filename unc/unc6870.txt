--- Abstract ---
The 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) made it illegal to
bypass digital locks or publish methods of doing so. Since then, digital
rights management (DRM) technologies have begun to appear everywhere,
from automobiles to home goods to medical devices. Today, modifying the
software on your slow cooker might be illegal.

products in ways they don=E2=80=99t approve of. That=E2=80=99s wrought havo=
c on software
hackers as well as unauthorized resellers and repair shops.

nd
how hackers can fight back. We=E2=80=99ll also discuss other methods that
manufacturers have used to shut down secondary markets, including
patents and license agreements.
