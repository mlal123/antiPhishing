We have started populating the advising calendar (see the undergraduate
programs page  on our
website).  If a slot is not set up for appointments, that means that it is
walk-in hours.  We will try to be explicit on the entries, but it should be
clear by just looking at the calendar on the bottom of that page.

If you have a departmental hold on your account, you MUST visit an adviser
in person to have it removed.  The hold is put on people new to the major
or who are on a tight schedule for graduating.  We want to make sure that
those people are getting in to the right courses.

If you do not have a hold but are considering anything "special" -- such as
study abroad, honors thesis, research opportunities, internship during the
semester, ... you should also make sure to see an adviser.

If you are having trouble with comp courses this semester, you should see
an adviser.

Finally, if you just want to talk about the major or your courses, we are
always happy to talk to you as well.

Have a great rest of fall break.
