As long as your hyperlinks take me to the article itself, you should be good to go. Do also make sure to include a basic citation for each source at the bottom of your blog post as we discussed in class.

Hi so if I hyperlink a certain source multiple times for the different parts of my arguments and evidences am I suppose to highlight where you can find each part or somehow provide where in the source you'd be able to verify my info?
