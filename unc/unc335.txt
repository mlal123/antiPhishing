Hello Club Racquetballers!

Because the people who worked the game this past Saturday were SO freaking =
awesome, the woman in charge of event services thought of us when they need=
ed to staff ESPN positions this Saturday. Sounds like you might get a chanc=
e to be on T.V. :-)

Greg and I have that tournament in Charlotte this weekend or I'd go myself,=
 since this particular work gets us SO much $$$, I'd hate to pass it up com=
pletely. Would anyone be interested in partaking?  From what I heard about =
this past weekend the hours were long but the work was easy.  The club gets=
 $10/hour....which is WAY more payout than any event hosted by the Sports C=
lubs (Ramses Recycles, etc.). Which is why these spots filled up SO fast - =
we were so lucky to get the ones last weekend!

If you can, please let me know ASAP!!!

Thanks guys!
Stephanie

Good Evening Stephanie =96

I wanted to touch base with you just real quick, I am not sure if you were =
able to sign up to work with any of our counterparts at football, but we ma=
y have some additional hours available if your group is available. We have =
been asked to staff some ESPN positions this coming Saturday, because of th=
is I can offer some additional hours. Would your group be interested in pro=
viding some people this Saturday? Report time is 10 AM, the game is at 12 N=
oon. You are certainly not required to, just wanted to offer it.

Thank you
Sarah
