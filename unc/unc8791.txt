In Memoriam
Thomas M. Carsey

(1966 - 2018)

Tom Carsey, the Odum Institute's director from 2011 to 2017, died Wednesday, February 21, 2018, after a long battle with ALS.

Tom was the Odum Institute's leader (and biggest cheerleader) during a difficult period for the University and, especially, for the institute. Tom
guided the institute in finding a new home in Davis Library, developed new business models to sustain the institute's services despite declining state
support, and refocused the institute's growth to reflect the influence of emerging computational and quantitative social science methods in the age of
social media.

Under Tom's leadership, the institute established a new unit for cyberinfrastructure, extended Odum's digital archive to a university-wide role as the
UNC Dataverse, became a national leader in Open Science and data transparency, and greatly expanded and updated its short courses and summer training
programs. He did all of this, and much more, with great patience, intelligence, compassion and humor.

Tom resigned from his position as the institute's director on June 30, 2017, but stayed involved in framing the institute's and the University's
efforts to foster data science and data-driven research on campus. Tom was our leader, our colleague and our friend. We miss him.

Memorials can be made to a travel fund for graduate students, created in his honor, to attend the State Politics and Policy Conference:

IDCC Workshop on Curating for Reproducibility

Our assistant director for digital archives, Thu-Mai Christian, traveled to Barcelona at the end of February for the 13th International Digital
Curation Conference (

) at Yale University. 
During the workshop, titled Curating for Reproducibility: Producing High Quality Data and Code for Transparent and Reproducible Research, participants
learned practical strategies for curating their own research materials with reproducibility in mind, based on the data quality review framework. 
This framework is used to make sure research data are well documented and usable, and that code executes properly and reproduces analytic results. 
Promoting reproducible research and data through curation standards and practices is the core mission of the CURE Consortium (
https://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=38&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cDovL2N1cmUud2ViLnVuYy5lZHUv&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
