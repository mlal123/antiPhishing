I hope you are having an enjoyable summer.  As many of you know, Jade Barri=
celli left UNC a few weeks ago.  I will be fulfilling Jade's duties while w=
e look to recruit someone to fill her role fulltime.  In the interim, pleas=
e feel free to contact me directly with any career-related questions, conce=
rns, or needs.

As you might expect, recruiting activities typically slow down during this =
part of the summer.  However, I did want to pass along this opportunity wit=
h Samsung (see below).

Thanks, and I look forward to working with you.
