Undergraduate Students:

UNC's Department of Computer Science has partnered with the Computing
Research Association (CRA) to get your feedback.

We are interested in your career development and *want to hear about your
experiences as an undergraduate student in the CS department*, as well as
your plans for the future.

To that end, I encourage you to complete a brief survey, which will take no
more than 20 minutes to complete. *The survey is completely anonymous.*
 And, *your feedback will have a direct impact* on future department
decisions.

*Completion of the survey means you'll be automatically entered to win more
than $1000 in Amazon gift card giveaway!!! The drawing will be held in
November.*
