Recruiting season is over and I'm breathing a sigh of relief. Thanks to
everyone who came out for the info sessions, tech talks, lobby tables,
career events and fairs, and took the time to read my weekly "books" that
hopefully helped connect you to a job or internship!

I now have a small favor to ask each of you:


   - *If you are coming back in the fall* (ie. NOT graduating), please take
   a minute to fill out the* summer experience survey
   * so that we
   know what kinds of things CS students are participating in this summer.
   This is data that the department has not historically collected but is very
   important. We need to see that the career program in CS is working.
   Personal identifiers are kept confidential!
   - *If you are graduating* you have probably been inundated with requests
   to fill out the *first destination survey*
   . If you have already done
   so, THANK YOU! If not, please take a minute to fill it out. The data is
   shared nationally and helps UNC and the CS department as a whole. Personal
   identifiers are kept confidential!

Thanks for a great year! I look forward to doing it all again starting in
September. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. Have a great
Summer!
