Subject: Morrison Staff Meeting


 
Hey Future Morrison Staff,
 
Firstly, I wanted to welcome you all to the Morrison staff for next year. I believe that we have a great group here and will do great things for the community as well as have some fun along the
 way. I look forward to working with each of you next year. 
 
I also wanted to set up a Spring meeting with you all to go over some important items and to give you a feel for what staff meeting will be like next year. The meeting will be between 1-2 hours.
 I have taken a look at all your class schedules and found that the best date and time is
Friday April 21st, 6pm-8pm. Please mark this in your calendars. It will be in the Morrison lounge/tv room. I know this is a Friday but I promise I will make it fun.

 
I want to thank you in advance for carving some time out for this meeting. If you are unable to make it for a special reason, please let me know. If you have any questions or concerns, please
 do not hesitate to let me know as well. I look forward to our first staff meeting soon. Thank you.

 
Regards,
