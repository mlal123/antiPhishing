Did you know that a lot of the seafood sold in our community is mislabeled?=
 That local, wild-caught tuna that you ate last night in Lenoir might have =
been a farm-raised catfish from North Korea! This summer we will focus our =
DNA sleuthing on the North Carolina shrimp industry. Students will measure =
seafood mislabeling using DNA barcoding and learn about the impacts that it=
 has on human health and marine ecosystems.

Students will be DOING REAL SCIENCE - actively learning laboratory techniqu=
es they can add to their resume, conducting experiments, analyzing data, pr=
eparing manuscripts for publication and engaging in discussions about the l=
iterature! After we learn the basic techniques, we head to the beach to pur=
chase seafood. Then we uncover the truth about the "Local, Wild Caught" shr=
imp everybody buys and eats at the beach every summer.
