I have not been able to reschedule the meeting about the new learning
contract system, so we are delaying it until the fall.  Summer learning
contracts will follow the same rumes as the fall:

   - You must use the most recent forms that are posted on the web site
   - All content except signatures must be typed
   - Signatures must be real signatures.  Electronic signatures are not
   acceptable; electronic images of signatures are fine for non-local people.
   - You must see me in person for learning contracts.  Emailing them to me
   or slipping them under the door are not acceptable.
   - Your account must be cleared of any holds that would prevent you from
   enrolling before we talk.

For CPT, I will sign the CPT form once you have been registered for COMP
293, not before.
