Etiquette tip: Roommates
Note from Marcia Harris:
Rather than write something about roommate etiquette, I am sending this art=
icle posted on LifeHacker.com, which I think covers the subject very well. =
If you are living with a roommate, I hope you will take a few minutes to re=
ad it.
Please let me know if you'd like to meet with me to discuss professional de=
velopment, business etiquette or career issues. I'll be available between 2=
:00-4:00 on October 22 and 1:00-4:00 on October 28. I can also schedule oth=
er times upon request. Please contact me at mharris@email.unc.edu if you wish to schedule an appointment.

[How to Be a Good Roommate and Deal with Those Who Aren't]
Roommate horror stories are pretty popular topics of conversation at colleg=

errible roommate.

I know bad roommates. Last year my noisy, inconsiderate roommate constantly=
 woke me up around three in the morning. Her side of the room was always me=
ssy and covered with clothes. Her suitcase from Christmas break didn't move=
 from the middle of the room all second semester. She used my makeup. She a=
te my food. One night, her boy toy stole my pillow off my bed. While I was =
sleeping on it. And she brought a kitten to live in our room (which, just b=
y the way, is totally against dorm policies). Y'all, I don't like cats. Not=
 even kittens. But who did the kitty like best? Me. Whose bed did it sleep =
on? Mine. Who did it wake up every morning to be fed? Me.
Oh, and it gave our room fleas. FLEAS.
While my rooming situation left much to be desired, I know that I probably =
wasn't the perfect roommate either. However, my roommate and I were still a=
ble to get along together fairly well (all things considered) and managed t=
o end the year on good terms. There are a few basic things you can do to he=
lp start off a successful roommate relationship and some tactics to help al=
leviate even the worst of rooming circumstances.
Respect Each Other
First and foremost, you need to respect your roommate. I know, sometimes, i=
t's really hard. But when you're living in tight quarters with the same per=
son (or people), if you don't respect them first, they sure as hell won't r=
espect you. Your parents have hopefully been teaching you what respecting o=
thers mean since you were about four. The same rules apply in college as th=
ey did in preschool.

  *   Be Considerate - If your roommate is sleeping or attempting to sleep,=
 keep the noise and light levels down. If your roommate is studying, don't =
have loud conversations in the same room. It really should be common sense,=
 but it is truly amazing how people don't understand what it means to be co=
nsiderate. If in doubt, ask yourself if you would be annoyed if your roomma=
te did whatever it is you would like to do to you. If the answer is no, tak=
e it elsewhere.

  *   Keep It Clean - Seriously, I cannot emphasize how many horror stories=
 I have heard about dirty roommates. Hair in the shower, toothpaste gelled =
to the sink, bathrooms littered with magazines or dirty clot=
hes. It's gross. Respect means keeping your side of the room clean. Now, I'=
ll admit, I'm a rather messy person. I don't like picking up my clothes, th=
e concept of drawers, or making my bed. But at least once a week, I pick al=
l of my stuff up off the ground and make my side of the room clean again. I=
t's a good habit to get into and it will make you a better roommate. And ho=
pefully, if your roommate sees you keeping your side clean, they'll be more=
 inclined to keep theirs clean.

  *   Keep Your Hands Off Their Stuff - Respecting your roommate means resp=
ecting their stuff. I already told you my former roommate used my makeup, u=
sually without asking. Just don't do it, especially with personal items lik=
e brushes and stuff like that. It's gross. If you really need to borrow som=
ething of theirs, always, always ask before you do. If they say no, don't g=
et offended. Some people just don't like other people using their stuff. Th=
is goes especially for food. It's super annoying to open the fridge and see=
 that your lunch that you planned to eat is now gone. If you eat your roomm=
ate's food, it is absolutely your responsibility to replace it.
Set Ground Rules
Now that we've reviewed what it means to respect each other, you and your r=
oommate should also establish some ground rules. It may sound a little Type=
-A personality, but it's really just better to set up what each of your pet=
 peeves are before the year gets rolling. For instance, I really don't like=
 it when people have phone conversations in the room while I'm studying. I =
don't multitask very well, and I'd rather be writing my paper on Roman glad=
iators than listening to you tell your best friend about your raging weeken=
d. Here is a list of things that you and your roommate should touch on as f=
ar as ground rules go:

  *   Talking on the phone - inside the room, outside the room, on the balc=
ony, in the closet, whatever. Make a compromise, but the tie should go to t=
he person studying.

  *   Visitors of the intimate kind - This seriously could warrant its own =
post. If you have someone of special interest with you, you need to remembe=
r that the room belongs to two people. Set up a sexile system. Rubber bands=
 on the door work, but everyone in the world knows what that means. Try a p=
ost-it note or piece of tape on the door, drawing a shape on the nametags o=
n your door, or some other symbol that will clue in your roommate that they=
 probably do not want to walk into the room. Include a time limit! Really, =
it shouldn't be longer than an hour. If you need more time, well, you know,=
 I can't help you. Compromise with your roommate. If you are the sexilee, b=
e patient. College is an exciting, hormonal time and your roommate will som=
etimes (or very often) put his/her libido ahead of your convenience. Find c=
omfort in the fact that they'll have to offer you the same consideration wh=
en you get your chance of love. Additionally, check with your roommate if t=
hey're comfortable with your lover spending the night if this proves to be =
the case. If they're not, respect their wishes.

  *   Cleaning - Discuss duties for cleaning and whose job it is to do what=
. Dividing responsibilities of cleaning will make keeping your room cleaner=
 and it will help ease roommate tensions if you both pitch in. Taking out t=
he trash, tidying the room, buying toilet paper, and washing the sink are j=
ust a few things to consider.
When All Else Fails...
Sometimes, no matter how much you do, your roommate will still drive you cr=
azy. When respecting, cleaning, and ground rules don't get you where you wa=
nt in your rooming situation, all is not lost, even if it seems like it. Th=
ere's still a certain amount of damage control that you can do.

  *   Deal with it - There are just some things that you are going to have =
to get used to when living with another person. Sometimes, you just need to=
 suck it up and deal with it. For the most part, the things that annoy you =
are minor things that you can put up with for just one year. If you have tr=
ouble keeping your annoyances under control, remember this quote from Rober=
t Anton Wilson: "You are precisely as big as what you love and precisely as=
 small as what you allow to annoy you."

  *   Talk to your roommate - Sit down and have a conversation with your ro=
ommate about the key things that really irritate you about the situation. M=
aybe he snores. Maybe she keeps the TV on while you do homework. Whatever i=
t is, don't yell and don't accuse. Be calm and friendly and simply explain =
your situation. Focus on the big aspects. If you start nitpicking or start =
getting mean, the situation will get out of control, nothing will get solve=
d, and you'll both be angry. Also, if you're going to talk to your roommate=
 about issues you have with them, you need to be able to take the issues th=
at they might have with you. Be flexible and willing to compromise.

  *   Talk to your RA - Do not do this before you talk to your roommate. Go=
ing above your roommate's head is inconsiderate. You are big boys and girls=
 now. You can work your problems out by yourselves. However, if you've talk=
ed to your roommate and something is still really causing a big disagreemen=
t between you and you roommate, you might need to get an outside party invo=
lved. If the situation really is irreconcilable, there is usually a process=
 that will transfer you to a different room with a different roommate.

  *   Get out of your room - This is probably the simplest of all solutions=
. When your roommate is in your room and doing something irritating, just l=
eave the room. Go to the library or a campus computer lab if you need to st=
udy. Go to a friend's room if you just need somewhere else to escape. Getti=
ng out of your room is good for you anyways, and some time away from your r=
oommate will help keep tensions from getting too high.
