Hey yall,


Practice tonight 6-9! Then normal practice times this weekend of 10-12 on S=
aturday and 5-7 on Sunday!


The tournament next weekend has been postponed-- our first tournament will =
be at home October 15th weekend.


Also, the last requirement for us to finish our Club Sports status is to ha=
ve everyone register on IMLeagues to our club roster.  Jessica and I will b=
ring our computers tonight to get the process done.  This is going to be a =
major PITA-- they decided a simple Excel spreadsheet was not high tech enou=
gh and now this process is awful (it's designed for intramurals, not club s=
ports!).  My point being, we need to get it done so we get our allocated mo=
ney for the year. It will be miserable, it will be pointless, and it will b=
e obnoxious. And yes, they did misspell the name of our sport.  Just wanted=
 to give everyone a heads up-- please be ready to take the 5-10 minutes ton=
ight to do it and bear with us when we yank you out of a court in middle of=
 a game.  It is not fun for us either....


Finally, bring dues! We need to get our check sent to the conference so ple=
ase pay!!!


See everyone tonight,

Greg
