get their scores sooner, don't worry). I expect those to be in sometime on =
Tuesday, so once I have them, I'll post them on Sakai. Shortly thereafter I=
'll also post the final letter grades on ConnectCarolina, but I'm not sure =
if you can see them right away or if someone needs to approve them first. S=
o bear with me on this, please, and hold off on=A0any questions in regards =
to the final=A0until you get those scores and grades=A0(it should be Wednes=
day at latest).  If I don't hear from you again, have a great summer, and g=
