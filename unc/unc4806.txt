The UNC graduate women in computer science (GWiCS) group is currently
planning the 3rd Annual Women in Computing Research Symposium.

This year we are holding the research symposium over two evenings; on March
23 we will have a panel discussion, and on March 30 we will hold a poster
session.

Our goal with the symposium is to introduce undergraduate students to
various research areas and encourage students, especially women, to explore
the opportunities they have for doing research, whether as part of their
undergraduate curriculum or by pursuing a graduate degree.

To register to attend this event, and optionally to present your own
research, fill out the form here: https://goo.gl/forms/Vs7Q9M0KZWCaYXDI2.
For more information about the symposium, visit our webpage:

computing-research-symposium-2017/.

We hope to see you on March 23rd and/or March 30th!
