in the U.S.  (No problem for U.S. citizens.) We prefer students who have
some experience in doing research computing on one or more of our systems,
such as Kure or Killdevil, and are familiar with Linux/UNIX operating
systems. Good communication skills, particularly written communication
skills, and problem solving abilities are essential.Student duties include
responding to persons who request assistance with some research computing
problem. Student employees are also expected to help maintain the Research
Computing on line help documents. By having direct access to the system
administrators and applications support experts, student employees have an
opportunity to learn about the systems in depth and can use that knowledge
to advance their own research computing work.  Capable students may also be
asked to teach one or more one or two hour courses that Research Computing
offers its user community.
