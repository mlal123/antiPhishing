Are you not graduating but planning to be around on graduation day?  I am
looking for a few student marshals to help out at commencement on Sunday
(May 14) from 3-5.  The ceremony is at Carmichael and we need some students
to hand out programs and to help direct the processional and recessional.
If you are interested, just drop me a note!

Thanks,
Diane
