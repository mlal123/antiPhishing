We will have demos running in various parts of the building.  We will train

If you are interested in participating in any of the events, please fill in
the google form .


These students have already been admitted to Carolina and we want to "close
the deal".    At last count we already had 70 people signed up for our
academic session and it will probably grow closer to 100.  This is a great
opportunity to show people why Carolins@CS is where they want to be!


Hoping to see many of you helping out.
