Will taught this course last summer and it was well-received.

Art History 290, The History of Video Games, will explore video games since
1963 from a variety of interrelated perspectives. We will think about games
not simply as formal objects, but also as cultural and historical
artifacts. As part of our coursework, we will play around 20 games, from
indie titles to AAA releases. Our discussions will be supplemented by field
trips to local game studios, including Ubisoft-Red Storm and Prologue
Games, as well as visits from a number of figures in the Triangle's
videogame community. The course has no prerequisites and students of all
majors are encouraged to apply.
