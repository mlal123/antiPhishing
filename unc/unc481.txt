Folks -- I mentioned this in class yesterday; so just a reminder.  But note
the location change for Wednesday.

Here's the deal -- we're using the Tuesday and Wednesday lab times (Tue:
5-8 PM and Wed: 4-7 PM) for midterm review.

First hour will be spent in reviewing basic concepts. And hours two and
three each day will be open to answer your questions.

Tuesday's review session will be in the usual lab location Brooks (FB) 007.

Wednesday's review session will be in Sitterson (SN) 014 - it is the large
classroom on the zero (ground) floor.
