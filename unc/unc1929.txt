You can nominate a faculty member in the CS department for the CS Undergraduate Faculty Award in this google form. Nominees can be teachers, for example, or any other faculty member that made your experience at UNC CS great this year. The deadline for this is May 2nd. This is your time to give recognition to those hardworking faculty members who helped you this year to be where you are today!

Thanks!
