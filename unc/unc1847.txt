There are three security-related classes being taught in the fall.  Here is
how they relate:

COMP 590-132 Computer Security Concepts (Sturton)  Prerequisites: COMP 410
and 411.  Designed as a security literacy course. We will cover a breadth
of topics, including topical news events.  It will not have the same depth
as COMP 535.  May not be taken by students who have already taken 535.

COMP 535 Intro to Security (Reiter) Prerequisites: COMP 410 and COMP 283 or
MATH 381. Principles of securing the creation, storage, and transmission of
data and ensuring its integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Topics
include access control, cryptography and cryptographic protocols, network
security, and online privacy.

COMP 590--091 Computer Forensics (Monrose) Prerequisite: COMP 535. You will
be helping design the new platform for computer forensics that future
students will use. Students will need a strong foundation, as group
projects will be moving rather quickly and will leverage expertise and
exposure acquired in the lab component of 535.
