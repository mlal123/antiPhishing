eve p=3D0.50), we were actually looking for (and found) the maximum=E2=80=8B n. The way to think about this is that larger n means more preci=
sion, so it is less likely that we would believe the claim as n gets larger=
.  I'm sincerely sorry for any confusion. I'll mention it Monday as =
well. As always, feel free to ask me if you have any questions.  Bes=
