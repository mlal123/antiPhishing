Hi all -

Please log into TIM and approve your timecard today *for the previous pay
period* that ended yesterday, 11/13.  Open your time card and select *previous
pay period* from the drop down at the top center of the screen.  Then if
everything looks good to you, you can click on "approvals" and then "approve
".  You have until 5 pm today to approve your timecard.

As always, if you have any questions please let me know!  We are still in
the old version of TIM until next week so everything should look familiar.

Thanks,

Beth
