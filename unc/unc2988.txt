Hi there,


I hope you are doing well. I am emailing you today in hopes that you can gu=
ide me, but I am not sure if I that is possible in this moment. I am in a s=
omewhat complicated situation and it is causing me trouble with my summer i=
nternship search. Due to the high school program I graduated from, I curren=
tly hold Junior status credit hour wise. However, I am a first-year in term=
s of residence and am not eligible to apply to the b-school until next fall=
 for the spring. With that being said, I expect that I would not qualify fo=
r the firms recruiting juniors since I will likely not be graduating in 201=
7. Are you aware of any summer accounting internships open to first-years, =
preferably in the Charlotte area? I have searched careerolina but was unabl=
e to find anything... I know UNC has strong connections with the Big 4, but=
 are there any other firms that have these same connections that may be mor=
e open to other students?


I greatly appreciate any help you can offer,
