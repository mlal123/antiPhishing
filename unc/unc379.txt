Unexpectedly, we have two spots open to practice coding interviewing with
Cisco tomorrow! One interview slot from *9am-10am* and another from
*1pm-2pm*. This is a great opportunity to practice technical interviewing
with professionals!

If you would like to take one of these spots tomorrow, please let me know
which time suits you. *The first student I get an email from gets the spot.
*You will need to bring a copy of your resume and wear business
casual (preferably) to the interview. I will send you details if you get
scheduled.

I will send a blast out when both spots are filled.
