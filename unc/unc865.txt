ETIQUETTE TIP: HOSTESS GIFTS

What is a hostess gift, and do you need to bring one?

A "hostess" gift (although it may also be for a host), is a small present t=
hat you may bring with you, or send afterwards, to thank your host/hostess =
for having you over for dinner, to a party, as a guest overnight, or someth=
ing similar.  The gift need not be expensive, but it should be thoughtful. =
 For example, if you know the recipient loves chocolate, a small box of gou=
rmet chocolates or chocolate bars would be nice. Other ideas are flowers, a=
 plant, homemade cookies, pretty paper guest towels, a bottle of wine, or a=
 small cooking utensil like a set of wooden cooking spoons.  It's always gr=
acious  to arrive with something in hand and to also send a thank-you note =
shortly after the occasion.
