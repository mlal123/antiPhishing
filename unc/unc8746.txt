Mason Mathews is our last PoP candidate.  He will be speaking 5-6 on
Tuesday (tomorrow) in SN011.  I am still looking for students who would
like to meet with him after the talk: 6-6:45 with a 15 minute discussion
with me afterwards.

I still haven't seen the topic of his talk.    He has a broad range of
experience, including teaching at Iron Yard, NCSSM and Duke and industry
experience at SciMed Solutions (which I think is no longer in business).

Please reply to this email if you are interested.

Thanks,
Diane
