I hop=
e this email finds you enjoying the first month of the semester being
 done.  I spoke with the Minor in Entrepreneurship about=
 an opportunity and I'm emailing to give you some information. If you're in=
terested in getting the full range of entrepreneurial experience, this oppo=
rtunity is for you. 




My name is Julian and I am leading the developm=
ent of a venture that produces an app/companion website which uses
 location based technology to connect people by allowing them to create pro=
files and  broadcast events they create on a map. Surrounding users ar=
e able to see the event and participate. Additional functionality includes =
the ability to create profiles, send messages,
 and coordinate registration. Also we are developing a facial recognition c=
omponent. This technology is focused on three primary areas: Greek (frat/so=
rority) life, fitness, and live music events. I explain the appeal for each=
 group below. Think of this technology
 as the Uber of fitness and socializing. 

Greek Life: The app/website streamlines communicating with=
 members in a chapter/between Greek organizations, creating private events =
for rush/socializing, advertising philanthropic events, collecting dues, co=
ordinating large events like Alumni
 Weekend/Homecoming/etc. 

Fitness: Often a person would like to go to the gym or wor=
k towards improving their physical fitness but they don't for a range of re=
asons. The technology helps connect you to others that are also lookin=
g for fitness support (gym buddy). Additional
 functionality allows already active people to broadcast events that you cr=
eate such as pick up games of basketball, etc and others can join.


Live Events: Want to see live music or find a specific typ=
e of food truck? Well this technology can help with that. Music venues are =
able to list who is playing and type of music that people can search. Also =
you can use the GPS feature to find
 your favorite food truck. 


We
 also are in the planning stages of a massive event (TriangleFitCon) that's goin=
g to merge technology and fitness, and bring together students from Carolin=
a, Duke, and NC State. Nothing of
 this scope and scale has been done in The Triangle before and we're approa=
ching national brands like Red Bull, GNC, Underarmour, and more to make it =
even bigger.  The app/website venture I mentioned at the opening of th=
is email will pitch and compete for ~$1.5
 million from big names including Kevin Plank (CEO of Underarmour) and Sequ=
oia (firm that invested in WhatsApp, Uber, YikYak). We have a close knit te=
am of about 16 Carolina students and want to have a couple more people join=
 the team to help with the portfolio
 of opportunities I have described. 


I was fortunate to have gotten my start in entr=
epreneurship
 at Carolina (and NCSSM) and to have used that start to lead ventures to su=
ccess (e.g. Nominated for 2012 White House Champions for Change Award, Indu=
cted into UNC's Order of the Golden Fleece, Awarded the 2013 Emerging Issue=
s Prize for Innovation, Awarded
 2013 Triangle Business Journal Top 40 Under 40 Entrepreneur award, etc). <=
/font>
Also this venture advanced all the way to the Finals of the Carolina =
Challenge last year. I have also helped members of the team land awards and=
 opportunities.


If you are interested (there is a lot to be don=
e), please email me at julian_wooten@med.unc.edu AND julian.wooten@gmail.co=
m
 (I get a lot of emails so I want to be sure that I receive it). I'm especi=
ally interested in Fitness and Greek Life enthusiasts but open to all. &nbs=
p;



I believe in purposeful entrepreneurship that p=
roduces disruptive change which makes life easier and more accessible.
 I look forward to hearing from you and potentially working together. =
 

And if not, I'll see you on Franklin next year when we win our next nationa=
l championship back to back. Calling it now
