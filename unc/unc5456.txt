Hey everyone,
=20
 I just posted the final letter grades on ConnectCarolina, as well as the f=
inal exam (those are points, not percentages) and homework scores here on S=
akai. I'm not going to post the histograms with everyone's scores plotted, =
but I still wanted to give you some feedback on the grades and the final.
=20
 First, the average on the final exam in our section was just above 73 poin=
ts (including make-up finals), and across all sections it was around 86.5 (=
not including make-up finals). The performances were mostly in line with th=
e midterms, meaning that those of you who did well there also did well on t=
he final, and unfortunately, those of you who didn't do well on the midterm=
s also didn't do well on the final. There were some exceptions, though, and=
 some of you went from, say, doing well to doing extremely well, and so on.
=20
 The final letter grade distribution was as I was telling you it would be t=
hroughout the term. 21.1% were A/A-'s, 39.5% B+/B/B-'s, 18.4% C+/C/C-'s and=
 the rest undisclosed. The average letter grade (convert letter grade into =
numerical grades, get the average, convert back to letter grades) was betwe=
en B- and C+, while the median letter grade was a B-.
=20
 Your total score needed to be 40% to pass (well, 39.279%). If the averages=
 on our midterms were 30 percentage points lower than in other sections (wh=
ich they weren't as the difference wasn't that high on average), then that'=
d mean our 40% would translate roughly to 49% in other sections. At best, t=
hat would be a borderline pass there, as well.
=20
 Lastly, if you're unsure whether you like math or not, I'd strongly encour=
age you to take MATH 381. In general, if you're planning on going to grad s=
chool, I think you'd benefit from that course. It's kind of a "cute" course=
 where you learn basic logic, but in a more rigorous way than so far, and w=
hile nothing there is going to be directly translatable to what you're doin=
g (unless you're in math), the skills you gain there will be. If you didn't=
 like MATH 233, I also wouldn't necessarily take that as an indicator you d=
on't like math in general. The way our course was structured, it's kind of =
hard to appreciate it, because the course was so calculational. You need to=
 know how to do these calculations, sure, but they're just a tool and not a=
n end like in these elementary courses. I mean, I can tell you if I had to =
take courses like this, I probably wouldn't be in math right now, so if you=
 can, take MATH 381, and you'll see there's a huge difference. If you do ta=
ke it and don't like it, then yeah, math is probably not your thing, but th=
e stuff you've done so far isn't much to go off of. And if you have any que=
stions in regards to this, feel free to e-mail me.
