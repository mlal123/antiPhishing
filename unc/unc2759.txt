From: Dylan Glotzer (dglotzer) - dglotzer@live.unc.eduHello all,  I have posted practice problems to Sakai under the Midterm 1 folder i=
n the Resources tab. Solutions will be posted tomorrow. A few notes:  <=
p>(i) The practice problems are not exhaustive, i.e. there may be mate=
rial on the exam that is not explicitly covered here. The practice set is l=
onger than the midterm, though. The midterm exam will similarly not be=
 exhaustive for our notes because it must be complete-able within 50 m=
inutes.   (ii) I recommend trying the practice problems by them=
selves before checking the solutions. There is a range of difficulty in the=
 problems, as there will also be on the exam.  (iii) A good method f=
or studying is to come up with other ways concepts may appear on the exam. =
Some of the practice problems are simple variations of questions that =
will be on the exam.  ~~~  Additionally, I will be holdi=
ng a Q&A review session on Monday 9/26 7:00-8:30pm in our regular room =
(Hanes 120). You are welcome to attend for some or all of it and ask questi=
ons about the homework, practice problems, notes, etc.  As always, l=
et me know if you have any questions.  Best,  DG  &nbs=
