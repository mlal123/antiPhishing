Hi all -

Your payroll actions have processed through the system, and you are now
able to log into TIM!  The URL for TIM is https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3a%2f%2functim.unc.edu&data=01%7c01%7cmlal123%40live.unc.edu%7cb4b53d7eb09940cd345c08d3d8043b9b%7c58b3d54f16c942d3af081fcabd095666%7c1&sdata=xGoqIpsYAQf49L1z3T%2ffbSVQlZbjbRXb5a%2fSYAbO9pU%3d, and you
will log in with your onyen.

Please review this tutorial on using TIM before you start -
