From: Buck Goldstein (goldstb) - buck_goldstein@unc.eduGood Morning=
  First, a general comment on Assignment 4.  Most of the papers=
 focused on process (meetings/communications) which is one key activity, I =
suppose, but in most cases process facilitates key activities as opposed to=
 an activity that has the potential to make the enterprise different. =
 Think about Porter's analysis of Southwest Air and the key activities that=
 make Southwest different and give it strategic advantage.  A happy st=
aff may contribute to happy customers but the actual activity this involves=
 is the little talk the flight attendant gives before take-off or the custo=
mer center attitude of the gate attendant.    Second, Jen =
and I have agreed on the dates for the capstone sessions of the class. =
; April 25-26.  The capstone will involve each of you doing a 30 minut=
e presentation that encapsulates your weekly submissions and other lea=
rning (both in terms of entrepreneurship and in terms of the next chapters =
of your story). I'll come up with an outline soon.  You'll have a=
 day after you get back from Yosemite to put the finishing touches on your =
presentation  and then we will all dive in together.  We'll start=
 at 9, break for lunch and get done around 3 each day.  Don't stress=
 out about the presentations.  If you submit the weekly assignments, p=
ay attention to the comments, maximize your learning from the Friday sessio=
ns and go "all in" on your internship you will be well situated t=
o produce a great final class presentation.  The grades from 325 won=
't be posted until the end of the semester but I didn't have too much leewa=
y since all three teams met the active user threshold. -------------=
