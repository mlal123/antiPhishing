Please be sure that all holds are removed from your account before your
registration slot.  There are very few students with holds that we have
placed and can remove.  Most holds are not ours.  Remember that seniors
need to be cleared for graduation and you may be seeing that hold.

Having said that, we strongly encourage you to come speak with an adviser
if you have any questions about courses that you should (or should not)
take.  Advising calendar on our department web site shows available walk-in
hours and appointments.

Additional reminder is that all learning contracts must be completed BY THE
END OF FALL SEMESTER.  No exceptions.

Have a great fall break!
