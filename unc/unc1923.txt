Yes, it would be fine to use Pokemon again, as long as you refer to a different context and class reading, as you mention.

Hey professor, would it be alright to repeat pokemon for my last post? I was going to make a different point of argument and interpretation and how in many ways pokemon embodies the Islamic beliefs of treating animals right according to Mahfouz Azzam. Would
 repeating the same artistic representation hurt my grade or would you just prefer I find a different artistic representation totally?
