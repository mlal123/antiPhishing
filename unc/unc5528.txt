Subject: [faculty] 2 phone scams targeting College Students
To: grads 
Cc: Faculty , Staff 


I have had 2 folks in the last 2 days mention to me that they received this
sort of call, the most recent FBI press release was issued by Agent
Bernazzoli, so I reached out to see if information was available to share
with our students.

He reiterated that The FBI will not call you related to unpaid student
loans, tuition, taxes, parking tickets,  etc .  Interestingly enough he
shared that he himself had received one of these calls at his work phone
number.

Additionally if you feel that your sensitive information has been
compromised  (bank account, social security number, etc.) you can file a
complaint through the FBI=E2=80=99s Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.=
IC3.gov

Please see the information related to this from previous FBI press releases
below:


College Students Targeted in Phone Scam
The FBI Atlanta Division is warning consumers to be on alert for a phone
scam that primarily targets college students while displaying the FBI=E2=80=
=99s
telephone number on the recipient=E2=80=99s caller ID.

The FBI has received multiple calls from college students at various
universities in Georgia, as well as universities in other states, to
include Wisconsin, complaining of a phone scam involving someone claiming
to represent the U.S. government or even claiming to be FBI agents. In
those cases, the caller advised the students of delinquent student loans or
dues, delinquent taxes, or even overdue parking tickets. On occasion, the
caller even threatens the students with arrest and not graduating from
school if these fees were not immediately satisfied via MoneyGram.

During each attempt to gain personally identifiable information from the
students, the caller claims to have specific student information. In
addition, the originating telephone number used by the scammer is displayed
or =E2=80=9Cspoofed=E2=80=9D as that of the telephone number of the Atlanta=
 FBI field
office.


*The public is reminded that the FBI does not call private citizens
requesting money and to never give out unsolicited requests for personal
information to callers that you don=E2=80=99t know.*

Individuals receiving such calls can file a complaint through the FBI=E2=80=

Scammers have targeted residents around the region, claiming to be the FBI
stating they are an =E2=80=9Cofficer=E2=80=9D of the FBI , Department of Ta=

Investigation. The intended victim is told that this is their final notice
and that their physical address is under investigation and an arrest
warrant has been issued under their name.

   don't have ties and did not initiate contact.
