From: Logan Tatham (ltatham) - ltatham@live.unc.eduHello class,=
  I really worked hard yesterday to get all of the finals graded and I'v=
e now graded them and put the scores up on Sakai. The average was a 145.67 =
with a standard deviation of 32.8. So, finally, I've learned how to right a=
 proper exam. There won't be a curve for the final, because the average and=
 standard deviation are already about right. Yay!  Overall, I was ve=
ry happy with your performance on the final. I'm actually a little worried =
that the overall average grade is too high (a 78%), but so it goes. If you =
earned a good grade, you've earned it! (Now I know not to curve grades unti=
l the end of the course- but you all benefit from my hav=
ing learned this now. This was my first time teaching.).  I particul=
arly liked grading the question about Logam finding love (not Logan- I can't write a test question about myself finding love, be=
cause that would be inappropriate...). For part b, on=
e student responded that Logam and the love of his life do meet in the midd=
le, assuming she's going towards Logam and not towards someone else. Anothe=
r student solved part a (incorrectly) and got that Logam goes 3/2 of the di=
stance towards her so they do meet, unless he just keeps on walking and pas=
ses her by. TOO REAL, people!  So, the point of this email is to loo=
k at your grade on Sakai. If you have any questions about your grades, let =
me know today or tomorrow. I'll put in final grades tomorrow evening. I hav=
e to keep your final exams for a year, but if you want to go over it with m=
e, let me know and we can meet.  I've really enjoyed sharing my love=
 of math with you all and hope that you've enjoyed it as well. I'm genuinel=
y proud of the progress that the class on a whole has made, and I hope you =
feel a deeper appreciation for math. Please feel free to keep in touch with=
 me (email, stopping by my office, social medias, clubs, ...) if you would =
like to.  Logan ----------------------This forwarded mess=
