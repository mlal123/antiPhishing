ind a way to get to class at 9 or soon thereafter.  If necessary, Keit=
h and I can ferry those of you stuck at the hotel up to Franklin Street in =
the morning.  Let us know if you need for us to provide transportation=
.  You might not know until  morning. If you still can't make it,=
 Conrad will provide you a link to the class and you can attend online.&nbs=
p; If you take this route, plan to get to town as soon as you can tomorrow =
