From: Logan Tatham (ltatham) - ltatham@live.unc.eduHello Class!  I just figured out how to upload photos to the roster in Sakai so that I can learn your names better. Again, this is optional, it is just to help me learn your names.  To upload a photo, go to the math 232 Sakai site, then click Roster on the menu on the left. From there, click on Pictures at the top, find your name, hover over it, and click "view full profile." There, you will see your name and a photo of an empty shell of a person. Hover over that empty shell and there will be an upload option, from which you can upload your own photo!  Thanks,  Logan ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "MATH232.001.S216" site.
