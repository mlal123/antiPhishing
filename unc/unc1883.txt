From: Jay Smith (jaysmith) - jaysmith@email.unc.eduI promised a few=
 words about the final exam, so...let me share them from a distant locale (=
I'm in New Jersey, attending a conference.)  The exam will consist o=
f three parts. An "objective" part will basically look exact=
ly like one of our quizzes, covering all material since the last quiz. A se=
cond "identification" section will ask you to identify quotations=
 from documents/books you've read. In this section (where you will have to =
identify 5 out of 6 or 7 quotations--all chosen from readings assigned sinc=
e March 3/4) you'll need to ID the text title, the author, the approximate =
date of its composition, and the meaning of the quoted passage in its histo=
rical context. Finally a third section will ask you to write an essay that =
prompts you to ponder connections between the seventeenth and eighteenth ce=
nturies (that is, material covered since March 2.) So...the final is not cu=
mulative, but the essay will ask you to make some big comparisons.  =
Hope that helps. ----------------------This forwarded message wa=
