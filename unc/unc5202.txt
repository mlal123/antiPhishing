Hey,
 
 As I said in class, homeworks are still going to be due a week from when the sections are covered in class, except for the last two and the true and false one, which are going to be due on May 1, 11:59 PM. However, you can extend all of the ones that haven't been due yet by asking for an extension within a day of the deadline. You'll then get an additional day (from the time of the request, I think) and there are unlimited requests. But the last possible deadline will be May 3, 11:59 PM, so if your extension is longer, it's just going to be cut off at that time. There will be no manual extensions if you forget to ask for an extension, so just make sure you keep these homeworks in mind.
 
 If, on the other hand, you want these to be due sooner so that you have access to solutions, e-mail me and I'll adjust the deadline for you.
 
 Lastly, the lowest homework score is getting dropped. I set that up in WebAssign, so I can already see these adjusted scores, but I'm not sure if you can. (This gets updated, so I'm not saying I'm seeing your final homework scores.)
