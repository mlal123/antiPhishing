Hello Lal,

 
First congratulations and I support your decision.

 
Just to clarify, you will finish this term Fall 2017 out and will not be returning for Spring 2018 as a Resident Advisor for Morrison Residence Hall.

Hello gang, this is just a follow-up from the other night. I have been accepted into the Burch Silicon Valley program for next semester, Spring 2018, and this means that I will have the opportunity
 to work in Silicon Valley for an entire semester while finishing up a minor. This is an opportunity that I don't want to miss out on and therefore I will sadly have to leave my position as a Residential Advisor for next semester in order to pursue this opportunity.
 I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, thanks. Cheers and have a great day.
