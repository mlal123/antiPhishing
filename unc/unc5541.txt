Hi everyone,


In Jade's absence, I will continue to send out internship and job
opportunities to the careers listserv as we receive them throughout the
summer. Have a wonderful Memorial Day weekend!


*Edible Campus UNC* is looking for a student interested in building an
*innovative, interactive
App* this summer!



*Job Description:* Edible Campus is a program of the North Carolina
Botanical Garden that converts garden beds across the UNC Chapel Hill
campus to growing edible and medicinal plants. There is great demand for an
App that is a user friendly, interactive map of our garden beds, that
shows where our beds are located, what is ready to be harvested in each
bed, about the plant, and how to pick it!



We have a GIS student on board who will focus on map creation and updates,
and ecology interns working on the plant bios. We are just looking for an
App developer to help make the whole program a reality.



Please contact lmindlin@email.unc.edu if interested.
