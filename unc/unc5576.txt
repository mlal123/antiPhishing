Dear Colleagues,

Are there any undergraduate students at your institution that would be
interested in attending SC17?

The Experiencing HPC for Undergraduate Students program fully funds
about 25 students (US-based and from the rest of the world) to attend
the SC17 conference. (This year the conference is in Denver, CO from
Nov. 12 to Nov. 17). More details about the conference are at [1].

The program aims to bring a diverse group of undergraduate students
interested in High Performance Computing to the conference. They will
be given some dedicated lectures and will interact with experts in the
field, from industry, government labs and academia, all in addition to
having full access to the rest of the conference. This program
provides them a place to learn more about the field, and decide
whether they want to go into the HPC industry or to join a graduate
program in an HPC-related field.

The students do not have to be research active or be experts in high
performance computing, though these criteria will be taken into
account when selecting the students that will be funded. Indeed the
program mostly targets students in their sophomore and junior years
where such an experience can have the most impact on the rest of their
education and career. However undergraduate students at other stages
of their degrees will also considered.

More details about the program are available at [2]. Applications to
the program are open until July 10, though I recommend that interested
students apply now. The application link is at [3].

If you have any particular question you can send email to
hpcundergrads@info.supercomputing.org .
