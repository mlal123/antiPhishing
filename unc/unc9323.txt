Each year the computer science recognizes an undergraduate learning
assistant as the LA of the Year.  You are getting this email because you
have been in a class this year with an LA.  We are seeking nominations for
the award.  It's a simple form  --
just a name and what course and semester they were an LA.  Voting will
follow.  At that time, we you will have the opportunity to tell us why this
person deserves the award.  For now, we just need names to be on the ballot.

Thanks,
Diane Pozefsky
Director of Undergraduate Studies, Computer Science
