Could you imagine working in a public health capacity in French-speaking West Africa or Haiti? Or do you just like French? Consider signing up for French 204 in the spring.   This is a chance to make more progress in all four skills, use your French to create concrete poetry, learn about slam, read a real novel, explore art, traditions, current issues, etc.   See our flyer attached for more course information.
