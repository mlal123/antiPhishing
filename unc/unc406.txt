Attention: Holes 1 and 2 at the UNC-CH Disc Golf Course have been closed 
due to erosion. The baskets were removed yesterday at the request of the 
Outdoor Education Center. We hope to re-open these holes in the Spring. 
Giving these holes a rest during Fall and Winter will allow the build-up 
of leaf litter and re-growth of vegetation. Please skip straight to Hole 
3. One of the baskets has been moved to the left position of Hole 8 to 
serve as a practice basket.
