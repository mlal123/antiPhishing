Good morning everyone!

I hope you all had a great summer and a good start to the semester!  We're
glad to have you back!

We receive donations from alumni and friends of the department throughout
the year that help us fund many of the programs and services we provide.
Typically, we send the donor an acknowledgement letter signed by Dr. Jeffay
that thanks them for their gift to the department.  This year we are trying
a new and more personal way to thank them.  This is where you all come in!
We think our alumni would find it more meaningful if they heard from
students who are currently involved in CS at UNC.

We will host a *student acknowledgement and pizza party* once a month and
invite and encourage you to attend and write a short thank you note to our
donors.  We will have pizza, cards and a few prompts and examples if you
can't think of anything to write.

*Please join us this Friday, August 26th at 12:00pm in the Sitterson Lower
Lobby, for our student acknowledgement and pizza party!*  *We will take the
first 10 students to sign up!*

*Sign up here * and help us thank
our donors and alumni who make so many of our programs and services
possible!

Thanks!
Hope
