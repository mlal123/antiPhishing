Global Certificate Focus Group

Below is a blurb for a new Certificate in Global Engagement that the univer=
sity is thinking of putting together; but, we want your input. If you have =
any opinions, and want some free food,  we'd love to have a little of your =
time. Sign up here and we'll be in touch with s=
ome times and places.
Certificate in Global Engagement

Whether it comes down to the competitive edge in the marketplace, conductin=
g scientific research, teaching in a North Carolina school or putting on an=
 art exhibit, all of these things now take place within a global framework.=
  Even if your career goals don't take you out of North Carolina, you will =
still need to interact in a globally competent way in order to be successfu=
l.  The world is no longer some vague place "out there."

The University is working on the creation of a Certificate in Global Engage=
ment, open to all majors, that will allow interested students to demonstrat=
e global engagement and preparedness for future careers with a global persp=
ective.  There will be four cornerstones to achieving this certificate:  la=
nguage proficiency, an academic component satisfied by specific majors with=
 a global focus or any major + 12 additional credits in courses with a glob=
al focus, an experience abroad, and a choice of co-curricular activities.  =
Students who fulfill the requirements will receive a Certificate in Global =
Engagement and have a special designation on their transcript.

We'd like to get your input on this project from the student perspective.  =
Some of the things we'd like to know are:

*        Would this appeal to you?  Why or why not?
*        If not, is it because you don't feel that it has anything to do wi=
th your major or career interests?
*        If not, is it because you feel like a language proficiency require=
ment is too burdensome (it would be one level above the current requirement=
 of 3 semesters)?
*        If not, is it because you don't feel like your major requirements =
will accommodate more coursework?
*        If not, is it because you don't see yourself doing study, research=
 or an internship abroad?

Critical Language Scholarships

The Critical Language Scholarship (CLS) is a fully funded program for stude=
nts to gain an entire year's worth of language study over the summer in an =
intensive group setting. Undergraduate students, including graduating senio=
rs, and graduate students are eligible and no prior study of the language i=
s required, except in the case of a few languages. The fourteen CLS languag=
es are: Arabic, Azerbaijani, Bangla, Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, =
Korean, Persian, Punjabi, Russian, Turkish, and Urdu. Also, Swahili has bee=
n added this year.

Tripp Tuttle, the UNC-CH campus representative, will be hosting an informat=
ion session next week: October 22 from 5:00-6:30pm in Room 1009 at the Glob=
al Education Center. Students apply directly to CLS (applications are due =
November 23), not through the Center for Global Initiatives.

Please share with anyone you know who may be interested!
