Subject: Supported Undergraduate Positions on Summer Research Teams

The Johns Hopkins University Center for Language and Speech Processing is
hosting the Fifth Frederick Jelinek Memorial Summer Workshop (
http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/current). We are seeking outstanding
members of the current junior class to join a summer research workshop on
language engineering from June 11 to August 3, 2018.

The 8-week workshop provides an intense intellectual environment.
Undergraduates work closely alongside senior researchers as part of a
multi-university research team, which has been assembled for the summer to
attack some problem of current interest.

The teams for summer 2018 include:

* Multilingual End-to-End ASR for Incomplete Data
* Grounded Sequence-to-Sequence Transduction
* General-Purpose Sentence Representation Learning

We hope that this stimulating and selective experience will encourage
students to pursue graduate study in human language technology, as it has
been doing for many years.

The summer workshop provides:

* An opportunity to explore an exciting new area of research
* A two-week tutorial on current speech and language technology
* Mentoring by experienced researchers
* Participation in project planning activities
* Use of cloud computing services
* A $5,600 stipend and $2,300 towards per diem expenses
* Private furnished accommodation for the duration of the workshop
* Travel expenses to and from the workshop venue

The application is linked from the workshop=E2=80=99s page (http://www.clsp=
.jhu.edu/
workshops/current). Applications should be received by Friday, March 2nd,
2018. The applicant must provide the name and contact information of a
faculty nominator, who will be asked to upload a recommendation letter by
March 9, 2018. Please note that the application will not be considered
complete until it includes both the CV and the letter.

Questions can be directed to the JSALT2018 committee at
jsalt2018@clsp.jhu.edu .

Applicants are evaluated only on relevant skills, employment experience,
past academic record, and the strength of letters of recommendation.  No
limitation is placed on the undergraduate major.  Women and minorities are
encouraged to apply.
