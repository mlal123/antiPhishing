u a chance to share diverse perspectives, pool your knowledge and skills, h=
old one another accountable (and on task), and get support and encouragemen=
t to take risks. You will develop new approaches to resolving differences, =
build a small community within a large class, learn new study strategies fr=
om your peers, and it will allow the whole class to hear from a wider range=
 of students. I will call on groups to participate in discussion throughout=
 the semester, which spreads out the responsibility of participation to eve=
ryone, not just those who are quick to raise their hands.  Questions? Conce=
