Important Health Insurance Information for New and Transfer Students

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill requires  all eligi=
ble students to have health insurance.  Students must WAIVE with their own =
existing creditable insurance each semester or they will automatically be e=
nrolled and billed for the UNC System Student Health Insurance Plan (Studen=
t Blue), administered by BCBS.

Waive/Enroll Deadline:
Spring 2018 - January 31, 2018


Students pay the health insurance premium through their University student =
account. The health insurance charge of $1,270.00 is added to tuition and f=
ees each semester for all eligible students.  Students are automatically en=
rolled in the Student Blue Health Insurance, and the charge remains on thei=
r University account unless they successfully complete the online waiver pr=
ocess and receive an approved waiver email from Student Blue each semester.

THE PROCESS:

go to the Student Blue website. New and transfer students need to REGISTER =
as a New User, using their PID and date of birth.  Select Enroll or Waive o=

 sent once the waiver is verified and approved or denied by BCBS.  To WAIVE=

nd receive an approved waiver email.   This process must be completed onlin=
e.  Sending your insurance information to the University does not take the =
place of submitting your online waiver at Student Blue.

With an approved waiver, the $1,270.00 premium is removed from the Universi=
ty student account.  This usually takes 5 - 7 business days.  If the waiver=
 is denied, the charge remains on the student's account and the student is =
enrolled in the health insurance.

te on or before February 1, 2018.  An approved waiver is required whether y=
