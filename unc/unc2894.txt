Hi all -

We are back to our regular schedule for TIM approvals, so *you have until 5
pm today to approve your own time card for the pay period that ended
yesterday, 10/2*.

I've pasted below the instructions from last time since some folks are
still getting used to things.

Please let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks,
