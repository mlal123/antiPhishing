Hello future racquetballers!


Hope everyone had a great FDOC!


This Thursday, the 24th, will be our first practice! We play in the upstair=
s courts from 6:00pm-9:00pm. You are free to come for as long or as little =
as you want. If you are unable to make it, don't worry! You are welcome to =
join us next Monday as well at the same time!



First of all, we are a competitive club that plays in a conference of 16 sc=
hools.  *That being said*, our primary goal is to grow the sport so we welc=
ome ALL skill levels and ALL commitment levels!



The first practice will be focused on explaining the rules to everyone who =
do not know them all.  We practice in the upstairs courts in Fetzer Gym.  I=
f you do not have your own equipment (don't worry, almost nobody does to st=
art out), we will show you where to rent some gear in Fetzer.



To get to practice, come in the entrance to the SRC directly across from th=
e Student Stores.  When you enter you will swipe in with your OneCard, then=
 will see a weight room in front of you.  Go down the hallway to the right,=
 which will dead-end into some stairs. Go up two flights, and there we are!=
 We will try to have someone to direct you all up there. Note that you will=
 pass by the downstairs courts-- we only use the upstairs ones!



If you have any questions or have any trouble finding us, feel free to emai=
l me at this address or shoot me a text/call (919-518-6323). If you do emai=
l, make sure not to reply to the whole listserv, just my personal email.



See you all Thursday!
