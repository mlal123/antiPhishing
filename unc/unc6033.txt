Hi all -

If you are receiving this email, you are a work study student this fall and
you now have access to TIM!  I just have a couple of housekeeping things to
go over -

Please watch the TIM tutorial at
https://apps.fa.unc.edu/finance/training/tim-students-temps/ and when you
are done, print the certificate at the end, fill in your name, sign and
date it, and bring to me.  Electronic or hard copy is fine, as long as it
has your legibly written name, your signature, and a date.  *Even if you
have used TIM before, please complete the tutorial and send or bring me
your training certificate.*

Once you have completed the training, start using TIM to log your hours.
If you have any hours that you worked in the interval between getting hired
(i.e. doing your I-9 with myself, Robin, or Jodie) and receiving this
email, please notify your supervisor immediately and they will enter these
hours into TIM for you.  Supervisors, as always I am available for
assistance.

I will be emailing you every other week asking you to approve your timecard
for the previous pay period.  This will be covered in the tutorial, but *it
is very important to realize that employee timecard approvals cannot be
removed.*  That is, if you approve your own timecard for the current pay
period, you will be unable to clock in/out for the remainder of that pay
period and your supervisor will have to enter every punch for you.

As always, if you have any questions please let me or your supervisor know.

Thanks,

Beth
