From: Buck Goldstein (goldstb) - buck_goldstein@unc.eduHi All  =
I have read all of the final exams and, unexpectedly, they turned out to=
 be a great focus group. The comments helped immensely in understanding the=
 relationship between 125 and 325 as well as suggesting how we can improve =
325H next year.  I think Jen will find the sections on your personal g=
oals for the semester helpful as well as she works to make the semester as =
productive as possible.  My take aways from your comments are: 1) loca=
te the seminar far enough away from campus that hanging out with campus fri=
ends is not possible; 2) embrace the group work--that seems to be the most =
valuable part of the experience; 3) important  learning outcomes seem =
to be:  how to maximize customer feedback, understanding customer deli=
ght, the importance of strategy and the importance of focusing on a measura=
ble goal even if it seems unattainable (300 active users).   I =
need to do some checking before posting final grades.  It may be best =
to wait until the end of the semester but I will keep you posted.  I a=
m already looking forward to your final presentations at the end of the sem=
ester to see how well you achieved the goals you have set out and to learn =
what else you accomplished over the semester.    -------=
