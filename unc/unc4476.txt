Spring recruiting season will be wrapping up in a few short weeks. If you
are still looking for a job or internship, LISTEN UP!

Next week on Wednesday and Thursday, we have the last 3 BIG recruiting
events for the semester.


*Diversity Fair | Wednesday, February 22rd | 3-6pm |Great Hall, Student
Union*
This Fair focuses on bringing together students and employers who are
interested in creating work environments that value and promote workforce
diversity. At UNC Chapel Hill that would include a variety of things
including but not limited to ethnicity, gender, religious background,
national origin, race and gender identification. To view and research the
list of the organizations to be represented, visit: http://bit.ly/UNCDiv17 (No
RSVP Required)


*Spring Job & Internship Expo | Thursday, February 23rd | 12-4pm | Rams
Head Rec Center*
This is the largest grouping of employers you will find in one place all
semester! If you are looking for a job or internship, attending is a
must! *Attached
you will find a spreadsheet that I created for you to make it easier to
begin researching employers that are attending and recruiting CS students*
(they are highlighted in yellow!) Come dressed in business casual, bring
plenty of copies of your updated resume, and be sure to use the attached
spreadsheet to inform yourself before the expo so you have some idea what
to talk to employers about. (Much better than walking up and asking "what
do you do?") See you there! (No RSVP Required)


*LInCS Networking Reception | Thursday, February 23rd | 5:30-7:30
|Sitterson Hall*
The LInCS Networking Reception  offers
our students the opportunity to connect directly with employers in a
variety of fields. Representatives will be stationed around the Sitterson
Hall lobby to answer questions and talk to students about full-time and
internship opportunities within their company. Employer profiles will be
available closer to the date of the event to help you get the most out of
the opportunity. Registration is required for students, and business cards
and resumes are encouraged! *RSVP Here:* https://goo.gl/forms/
