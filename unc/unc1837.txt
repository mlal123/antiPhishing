Yes, you can write assuming the reader has background knowledge of the Qur'an and Islam.

Hey professor, I just had a minor question. Should I work under the assumption that the reader is familiar with what the Qur'an is and the religion of Islam or do I mention in a paragraph with a brief overview of the Qur'an and Muhammad and such that might
 be important in understanding Islam for the reader?


(I know you'll be the one reading and I know you do know about Islam and such but I guess out of formality should I include it?)
