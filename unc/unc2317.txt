Hello:
 
The item’s on your ‘To-Do’ list are actually from 2015/2016, from previous loans that had been offered to you. I have cancelled those items and they are no longer
 on your ‘To-Do’ list at this time. Thank you and have a great day.

Hey, there are a bunch of loan stuff on my financial aid to do list, if I don't need them should I just ignore them? I'm a carolina covenant so I think I'm covered for the
 whole year.
