From: Jay Smith (jaysmith) - jaysmith@email.unc.eduFolks--just a quick reminder that we're going to take about 15 minutes tomorrow to discuss the Montaigne essay "On Cannibals" which was originally scheduled for last week. So please read it. It's not too long, and it's connected in different ways to both the French Wars of Religion lecture and tomorrow's lecture on changing times for the aristocracy. ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "HIST158.001.SP16" site.
