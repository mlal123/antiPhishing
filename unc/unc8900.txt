Good evening,
 
I hope this finds you well and settling into your internship! I am very excited to see everyone on the ground!
 
I am hoping to arrange a visit with you and your supervisor on either March 26 or March 27. I want to get a sense of where you work, what you are working on, and speak with your supervisor and you together about your role and
 work there.
 
Please check your supervisor’s availability March 26 and 27. Please send along full availability as I am trying to manage several visits if I can make them work. My plan is to spend two days on visits in the city and two days
 on visits in the valley.
 
Please send along any pertinent information regarding arrival, parking, security, etc.
  
Looking forward to hearing back from you on this shortly.
 
Best regards,
gina
