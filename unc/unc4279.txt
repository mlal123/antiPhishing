			Tomorrow, Thursday 2/2, we will be having a special speaker! Dr. Montek =
Singh will be talking about his research with camera sensors, detailed belo=
w.  If you have missed our last few, this is a perfect opportunity to =
join in and hear about what's going on in our department!
		
			IMPORTANT: The room is different this week:
		
			TIME: 6:00PM (same as usual)
		
			PLACE: Sitterson 011 (this is different!)
		
			Title:  From =
;Counting =
Raindrops =
to Taking Better Pictures
		
			Abstract:  The pr=
ocess of taking a photograph using a digital camera is not unlike measuring=
 rainfall intensity over a large area.  Yet, counting=
 photons reaching ea=
ch pixel, or counting rain drops hitting each square foot of land, is a surprisi=
ngly challenging task to do accurately, inexpensively and fast.  In th=
is talk I will describe a novel approach to designing a camera sensor that =
yields dramatic improvement over the current state of the art, providing si=
gnificantly higher dynamic range, smoother color gradations, lower noise, a=
nd frameless capture.  (No hardware background or knowledge of rain ga=
uges required to enjoy this talk.  Frustration with current phone came=
ras is a plus.)
		
			We hope to see you all tomorrow 2/2 at 6:00 PM in SN011.
