From: Buck Goldstein (goldstb) - buck_goldstein@unc.eduHi All  Gina just reminded me that the syllabus states the final grades for 393H will be determined as follows:  40% weekly blogs  40% final presentations  20% internship evaluations  We have your mid-semester evaluations and have solicited your final evaluations so I should have them in plenty of time to give the final grade.  See you next Wednesday. ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "ECON393H.01S.SP18" site.
