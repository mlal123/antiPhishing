Dear Biology 101 Lab Student,

Biology 101 Labs begin January 23-27.  Check-in is NOT required but you will need to purchase the lab manual (Laboratory Exercises for Biology 101) from Student Stores since you will be doing a lab activity the first day.  Please read the Introduction and the first two chapters of the manual to be prepared for lab.

This course meets a CI (Communication Intensive) requirement thus there is a writing component.  You will work on outlines, a rough draft and two lab reports in addition to an essay.  There are other small assignments too.  Collaboration on any written assignments is not permitted.  When you leave lab the work you do on assignments should be done by you alone.  We uphold the Honor Code in this course and possible violations will be reported.  You are welcome to use the Writing Center for help.

If you plan on dropping the lab, you will need to do this yourself.  The department will not drop you if you don't show up to the first day of lab.  

The lab syllabus, slides and other information is available on the Sakai site for this course.  The site is called BIOL101L.401.SP17 for ALL sections.  Be sure you know which section you are enrolled in so you know what room to go to.

Last, the Biology Placement Exam will be administered on Monday, January 16th at 4:00pm in Wilson Hall 107.  You need to register for the exam so go to the link below if you plan on taking the placement test.  More information about the placement test can be found on the Biology Department website (undergraduate program).

Have a good semester!
