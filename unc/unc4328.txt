Hey everyone,

Due to the water issues on campus we weren't able to have our scheduled One
on Ones this past Friday. I'd really like to make these up ASAP so I can
get everyone on the same page and schedules sorted. Tomorrow I'm going to
stay in SN 136 (Software Systems Lab) for extra time. Please come by if you
can so we can have our one on ones during this time. They should only take
15 minutes, so please try to find the time.

If you absolutely cannot make it during this time, please email me.
Otherwise I look forward to seeing you.

Daniel Korn
