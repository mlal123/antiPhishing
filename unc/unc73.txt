The summer is almost over and we would love to have pictures from your
summer to share! This summer if you did an internship, attended conference,
presented a paper, studied abroad or volunteered, please send us a picture
and a brief description so we can share on social media the interesting
things our students are doing. We would love to hear from you!

Email your submissions to rsac@cs.unc.edu and stay tuned to our Facebook
 & Twitter   to
see what other students in the Computer Science department are doing
this summer.

Thanks!
