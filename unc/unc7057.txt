manner. Look out for one another and seek help if you or someone else needs=
 it. Please consider the personal, social, and legal consequences of overco=
nsumption of alcohol and other illegal behaviors. Our university=E2=80=99s =
alcohol policy includes a medica=

na=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CGood Samaritan=E2=80=9D law provides similar protecti=
ons. If you see someone who needs help, call 911.

Additionally, while Halloween is a time to celebrate with original and crea=
tive costumes, please keep in mind when choosing costumes that taking eleme=
nts of other cultures and caricaturing them for the sake of costumes is ina=
ppropriate and should be avoided.

We hope all Tar Heels have a safe and festive Halloween.
