Dear Residents,

As you have heard from the most recent Alert Carolina message, the Town of =
Chapel Hill and the campus continue to be under an appeal from OWASA (Orang=
e Water and Sewer Authority) to conserve our water usage until the supply c=
an be restored to normal levels.  As students living on-campus, you can hav=
e a tremendous impact on these conservation efforts.  We do want to be clea=
r that both on and off campus students AND Chapel Hill residents are being =
requested to conserve water due to the current shortage.  This is not just =
a campus shortage.  As one effort, you will soon see signs in your bathroom=
s with these conservation tips.  Please do all that you can to assist Chape=
l Hill and surrounding communities to conserve this precious resource.

Best ways to conserve water:

  *   Take short showers (less than 3 minutes).
  *   Delay washing clothes and dishes.  If you must, wash only full loads =
of clothes and dishes.
  *   Turn off water when not in use for brushing teeth, etc.
  *   If you observe any leaks in toilets, faucets, pipes, etc. please cont=
act Fix My Room.


We will continue to provide updates as new information is available.

Thank you.
