Each year, the Computer Science Department, in conjunction with SAS,
 presents the Charles H. Dunham Scholarship to a student in their junior
year.  The award is made based on academics, community involvement, and the
ability to work well in a group environment.

The award includes a summer internship at SAS as well as a scholarship.
This year we are requesting students interested in the award to submit an
application.  This is really an excellent opportunity and I encourage any
juniors who are interested to submit an application.

*By submitting the application, you are agreeing to accept the internship
at SAS if you are given the award.*

Applications are due *March 3 *and the winner will be announced by *March
10.  *

The application is a fillable pdf.  You can submit it electronically with
an electronic signature or you can bring me a paper copy.

Best of luck.
