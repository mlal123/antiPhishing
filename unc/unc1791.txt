I apologize for this email blast but I'm trying to identify which of our
majors are transfer students and the university doesn't make it easy.  The
reason that I want the information is that there are a number of events
coming up for prospective transfer students and I would like to involve the
students who have already been through the process.  If you are a transfer
student, please fill out this 30-second survey
.

Thanks,
