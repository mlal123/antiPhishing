From: McNair Mitchener (mcnairhm) - mcnairhm@live.unc.eduHi Teams,<=
/p>  We have just randomly selected the groups that will have the chance=
 to present in front of our "sharks" on 11/28 for the extra credi=
t opportunity. Everyone will have turned in their presentations and final p=
ackets before this class, but this will give selected teams an extra chance=
 to get some practice, and extra feedback before pitch day on 11/30. <=
/p>  The selected teams are: 17, 54, 42, 69, and 83. Sorry to those of y=
ou who wanted to present as well, but we had a lot of interest and limited =
space.  Happy Thanksgiving and see you all after break for an exciti=
ng last few class periods!  MHM    --------------=
