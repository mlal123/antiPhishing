Hey,
 
 For those of you that haven't picked up your midterms yet, I'll have the third one with me on Thursday, and I have the rest of them in my office. So please come pick them up if you want them before the final exam, because I'm not sure when I'll be on campus after Thursday. I'm sure I will be sometime, but I don't know when at this point. Anyway, you don't have to come to class if you don't want to, but just come pick them up afterwards during my office hours or right after class, if nothing else. Especially the second midterms I've had sitting in my office for a while.
