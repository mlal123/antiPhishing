Welcome back!

The beginning of the school year is always an exciting time for us here at the Odum Institute. Students, faculty and staff come back with all sorts of
new questions and projects, and our staff is ready to help. This year, remember that the Odum Institute is dedicated to making the research process
easier and more productive for you, your colleagues, and your students.
We have experts in quantitative, qualitative & mixed methods and analyses, survey design & methodology, data science, data management & curation, and
cyberinfrastructure. Most are available to the Carolina community for brief, no-cost consultations in person or over email. To find the consultants
and services you need, please visit the Research Support page (

Despite the ongoing construction in Davis Library, we are still open and accessible during our regular hours of 9:00AM to 5:00PM, Monday through
Friday. See below for a map of the best way to get to us.
