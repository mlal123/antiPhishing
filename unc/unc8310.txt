Hello Everyone,

This is a reminder about today's ConnectWise Resume Reboot in Sitterson
Lower Lobby. Bring your resume for a quick review and feedback from
ConnectWise recruiters. Your resume does not need to be "final" for you to
take part in this service; bringing a draft resume is even better.

ConnectWise will be here from 10:00-1:00 p.m. so don't miss the chance to
get your resume reviewed by someone who has hiring experience.
Have a great week!
