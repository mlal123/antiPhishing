Replication and Reproducibility Work at the Institute

As concerns about the integrity of published scientific results continue to grow, journal editors have issued policies that increase the
reproducibility of research through data access and research transparency. 
The Odum Institute Data Archive (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=33&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly9vZHVtLnVuYy5lZHUvYXJjaGl2ZS8%3D&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
)offers a range of data curation and verification services (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=33&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly9vZHVtLnVuYy5lZHUvZmlsZXMvMjAxNy8xMS9EYXRhVmVyaWZpY2F0aW9uLnBkZg%3D%3D&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
) to scholarly journals to support implementation and enforcement of data policies.
For the most stringent of data policies that require verification of author-submitted data to ensure they can be used by a third party to reproduce
findings in the published article, the Odum Institute Data Archive works with statisticians to perform data curation and code review to support these
policies. 
Below is a high-level illustration that represents the integration of the manuscript publication and data curation + verification workflow for a
journal that requires authors to submit data, code and documentation for independent review and subsequent publication as a condition of final article
acceptance.

Consultation Services 

The Odum Institute provides consulting services on every part of the research life cycle: research design, data collection, data management, analysis,
and research products. 
In addition to offering a walk-in statistical consulting service, staffed by graduate students daily (Monday-Friday) in the Research Hub, we offer
scheduled consultations with full-time staff on quantitative methods, statistical computing, survey methodology, data management, data science,
qualitative research, and mixed methods. Walk-in hours are also available for users seeking assistance with the online survey tool Qualtrics.
Consultations range from a single meeting to numerous sessions to assist researchers, from graduate students to senior faculty, during a long-term
project or program of inquiry. 
For more information on how to find and contact a consultant, please visit our FAQ page (

Basic Access to Census Data

January 17 | 9:00am - 12:00pm | Health Sciences Library, Room 227
 This is a hands-on workshop organized by the UNC ResearchHub (

) to help users understand the strengths of various Census data retrieval tools, both freely available ones and those to which the library subscribes:
American FactFinder, the Census Bureau’s freely available database; Social Explorer, a commercially licensed tool to which the library subscribes;
and the grant-supported (so, free to you) National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS).
These tools provide access to pre-constructed data tables published by the Census Bureau. Some are better for the most recent data and others are
useful for historical data. Come learn how to choose the best tool for your research, and the ins and outs of each tool.

Getting Started with R (Part 1)

January 18 | 2:00 - 3:30pm | Davis Library ResearchHub
 We are kicking off R Open Labs with two full-length short courses: Getting Started in R – Part 1 and Part 2. These short courses will help you
install the necessary software and introduce you to the fundamentals of working in R.
Once you’ve completed Getting Started in R, you can continue to practice and develop your skills by attending our weekly R Open Labs. Each lab will
include a period of brief instruction on a new topic, followed by time to practice, work together, ask questions and get help.

) to help users understand the strengths of various Census (and other survey) data retrieval tools which allow the creation of custom
cross-tabulations (that is, custom data tables).
Tools to be covered include: DataFerrett; iPUMS; TerraPopulus (in beta); and the Triangle Research Data Center (TRDC). The first three tools are
freely available and we will focus on their census data content (U.S. for DataFerrett; U.S. and international for iPUMS and TerraPopulus).
Researchers must apply to the Census Bureau (or other federal agency, e.g., the Centers for Disease Control) for access to the TRDC in order to
utilize various survey microdata. Application procedures will be discussed.

Making an Impact with Data Visualization

January 23 | 2:00 - 4:00pm | Davis Library ResearchHub
 Collecting data is now easier than it has ever been. But, as data becomes more prolific, datasets become larger and more complex. How do we find
meaningful patterns in our data? How can we communicate those patterns to others? Data visualization allows us to make sense of today’s ever
evolving information landscape.
This workshop, organized by the UNC ResearchHub (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=33&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cDovL2xpYnJhcnkudW5jLmVkdS9odWIv&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions

NVivo Hands-on Workshop (Part 1)

January 30 | 2:00 - 4:00pm | Davis Library, Room 3010
 This session will allow participants to work through a textual document in the PC version of NVivo, a software program for coding textual data such
as interviews, focus groups, and field notes. It combines editable text and multimedia capabilities with searching and linking, as well as theory
building.
Text files can also be linked to graphics or audio files. The program provides an attribute system which can be used for coding demographic variables.
It supports visual models, including the specification of types of links between objects in the model.

), will introduce attendees to the Python programming language. We’ll help you install Python 3 and the Anaconda distribution, execute your first
lines of code, and explore the basic functionality of Python.
After this workshop, attendees should be better placed to start working on a specific project in Python, learning along the way, or work through more
in-depth training.
Python is widely used by researchers in many disciplines, and can be used to accomplish or automate many tasks outside academia. General computer
skills are required, but specialized prior knowledge in computer programming is not required.
