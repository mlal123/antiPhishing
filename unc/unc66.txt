As a Computer Science major (or minor), you are qualified to have a user
account on the Computer Science Department systems, and I just set up the
account. This account will allow you to log in to public machines in
Sitterson Hall and the Fred Brooks Computer Science Building, access web
pages limited to department users, and use some specific CS Department
servers that might be needed for your coursework in upper level courses. In
addition, it includes an account on the department's Google Apps domain,
allowing you to use the department's Google calendar, groups, google drive
and various other apps. Note, however, that email receipt is not enabled
for your department Google account; mail to your_login@cs.unc.edu is
forwarded to your campus account. You have been added to the
majors@cs.unc.edu careers@cs.unc.edu email group.

To activate your account see: http://cs.unc.edu/help-article/new-accounts/

In addition, as a major you are eligible for a Sitterson/Brooks building
access card, which will let you into the building after hours. You can get
your access card the first 2 weeks of class by stopping by the front desk
in Sitterson Hall. You will need your UNC photo ID.
