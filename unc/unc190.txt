There is so much going on in the department that we have chosen to have two
"open houses" this year.  The first, is *THIS THURSDAY, AUGUST 27 5-7 in
Sitterson 014*.  This is our traditional open house, where we introduce you
broadly to the department and activities that are going on.  After our
presentations, Credit Suisse will give a presentation and sponsor pizza.
If you are new to the department, this is a good introduction and I
encourage you to attend.  Please spread the word to any of your friends as
well.

If you are looking for more detailed information about departmental
opportunities and job or internship searches, then our "Under the Hood"
Open House on* WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9 (also 5-7 in Sitterson 014)* is for
you.  Jade Barricelli and I will be diving into more detail about career
services offerings (and there are a large number of new ones that she has
added this year to really help you nail those interviews!) and some of the
upper-level opportunities in the department: internship course, mentored
research, RA and TA positions, study abroad, honors theses, BS/MS program
and how you may want to plan for these opportunities that will really
enhance your time at UNC.

You may, of course, come to both sessions or you can choose the one that is
right for you.  Our goal is to help you make the best use of your time.

Hope the semester has started well for you!
