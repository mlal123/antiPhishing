From: Dylan Glotzer (dglotzer) - dglotzer@live.unc.eduHello all,  I have posted a final practice exam under the resources tab on Sakai.=
 A few notes  (i) In a previous email, I mentioned the final would b=
e 10-15 questions. That was an overestimate, as you will be able to see fro=
m the practice exam.  (ii) As always, the practice exam is not exhau=
stive but should give you an idea of the kind of problems you can expect to=
 appear on the real final exam.  (iii) Solutions will be posted late=
r in the week.  Additionally, I am holding two Q/A review sessions b=
efore the final. These will be the same format as before the midterms. =
 (i) Sunday, Dec. 11th at 6-7pm in our regular room (Hanes 120)  =
(ii) Wednesday, Dec. 14th at 6-7pm in our regular room (Hanes 120)  =
   As always, let me know if you have any questions.  Be=
