strong>Menlo College, Menlo California/Winston House London England     Below is an Outline for your final Projects to be =
presented April 25-26.  Use this is as a guide but don=E2=80=99t let i=
t get in the way of being creative in telling the full story of your semest=
er.     The presentation should cover both your work exp=
erience and your experience outside of work.     Work:&n=
bsp; (10 minutes)  --Walk us through t=
he full business model canvas for the company or enterprise where you inter=
ned.  Integrate and update the weekly deliverables into the canvas.&nb=
sp; If more than one of you is working at the same company you should indep=
endently develop a canvas.  It will be interesting to compare them. &n=
bsp;Also discuss no more than three big challenges facing the company and y=
our suggestions for addressing them. This section is a chance for you to in=
coporate all you have learned from the boot camp, the class deliverables, y=
our internship and the great site visits and Friday sessions.  Non-W=

bsp;   --What Happened and What=E2=80=99s Next?  All of you =
were so creative and inspiring at boot camp with your Why Am I Here? presen=
tations, I wanted to provide you with an opportunity to give us an update.&=
nbsp; This is totally free form and will allow the creatives in the group t=

ponse to an open-ended prompt the last time we were all together.  &=
nbsp;  I hope this helps you begin thinking about your final =E2=80=
=9Crecital=E2=80=9D.  In terms of mechanics, we need a sign-up sheet f=
or the students at Menlo. Can someone make one? We can start at 9 both days=
 and allow a half an hour for each presentation so that we have around 10 m=
inutes for questions, ideas and suggestions.  We should break for lunc=
h each day for about an hour. By my calculations that means presentations f=
rom 9-12 and 1-2:30 both days. To the extent that any of the teams have con=
tinued to work on their idea (I know about at least one that has) we will m=
ake time for them to pitch after class on Wednesday if they like.  &=
nbsp;  For the London group, in light of the huge time difference, I=
 don=E2=80=99t propose to make you stay up all night and participate via Sk=
ype unless you want to.  We can set aside an hour before or after my v=
