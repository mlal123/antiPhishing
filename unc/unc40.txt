Thank you for reserving your textbooks from UNC Student Stores!

We have been busy this summer making sure you will have everything you need to get your first semester off to a great start.  We will have all of your required course materials picked, boxed, paid for, and waiting for you so you can spend your first weekend on campus doing more important things.

Your order number is ORDER #825.

You may pick up your reserved textbooks on Saturday, August 16, 2014, or any day (Friday through Sunday) on that weekend, upstairs in the UNC Student Stores.

Save this email and bring it with you to pick up your books in Student Stores on third floor in the Textbooks Department.  Student Stores is located in Daniels Building across from Lenoir Dining Hall and next to the Student Union.

1.	If you lose or forget to bring your order number, you must first go to the Check-in Table located outside at the entrance to the store.  In the event of rain, the Check-in Table will relocate inside the Textbook Department.
2.	With your order number and UNC OneCard, go to one of the ten (10) Pick-Up stations set up in the Textbook Department.  Each station is set up for a specific range of order numbers.  Go to the table set up for your order number.  The attendant will request your order number and retrieve your boxed books.  The attendant will also request your UNC OneCard photo ID to verify that you are receiving the correct order and you will sign a receipt for the books.
3.	If you wish to exchange or refund any books, you may go to the Exchange Desk at this time or you may complete the exchange at any time within the following two weeks.  Your pickup is complete and you may leave with your box of books.

It is important that you pick up your books on the assigned date.  If you have any questions, email us at newstudenttextreservation@store.unc.edu or call us at 919-962-8123.
