tomorrow!* Just as a reminder, here they are:

diversity. At UNC Chapel Hill that would include a variety of things
including but not limited to ethnicity, gender, religious background,
national origin, race and gender identification. To view and research the

*Spring Job & Internship Expo | Thursday, February 23rd | 12-4pm | Rams
Head Rec Center*
This is the largest grouping of employers you will find in one place all
semester! If you are looking for a job or internship, attending is a
must! *Attached
you will find a spreadsheet that I created for you to make it easier to
begin researching employers that are attending and recruiting CS
students* (they
are highlighted in yellow!) Come dressed in business casual, bring plenty
of copies of your updated resume, and be sure to* use the attached
spreadsheet to inform yourself before the expo* so you have some idea what
to talk to employers about. (Much better than walking up and asking "what
do you do?") See you there! (No RSVP Required)
