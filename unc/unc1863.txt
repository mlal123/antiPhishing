Dear Class:

WA 10.5 HW is due Friday, April 15 at 10 PM.

***
Before class on Friday, April 15, please complete and submit the Test 3 Review on WA so we can discuss the questions most frequently missed during class time.  You may also bring in any additional questions you may have.

***
Test 3 is on Monday, April 18.  Test 3 consists of 12 questions.  Please see the Schedule of Instruction for the sections on the exam.  The formulas from the Math 130 Formula Sheet will be on the Test 3 Cover.  Remember to bring your computer, photo ID, and a pencil.  A power cable is optional but recommended.  Any student who does not complete the test on April 18 will receive a 0 on the exam regardless of the reason.

The Test 3 keys will be released at 3 PM on Mon, April 18.  At that point, you can decide if you want to take a retake and if so, which one.

***
Friday, April 22 is reserved for students to get assistance before the retake day on Monday, April 25.  To prepare for the retake, review your first take test and the corresponding test review.  You can also use Practice Another Version and Master It on any relevant WA HW assignment.

***
Retake day is Mon, April 25 during your class time.  It will be just like any other test day, except you get to choose which test you take.  You may retake any one of the 3 tests given this semester.  You may take only 1 retake.  If you open a second retake, no retakes will count.  The retake will consist of 12 questions and be different yet similar to the version of the test you took, but cover the same sections and objectives.  The formulas from the Math 130 Formula Sheet will be on the Retake Cover.  The retake score will only count if it is higher than your first take score.  It would be a shame to waste this opportunity!

***
The Math 130 Final Exam is on Monday, May 2 from 4-7 PM.  The final will be taken with paper and pencil, not on your computer.   The final consists of 25 questions.  The formulas from the Math 130 Formula Sheet will be on the Cover of the final.

If you have 3 finals within 24 hours or a time conflict, you can get an exam excuse from your college.  The make-up final is scheduled for Thursday, May 5 from 4-7 PM.  The only way to take the make up is to have an official exam excuse or be on the infirmary list.  If you take the make-up exam, take your exam excuse and a photo ID to the testing site.  DO NOT give your exam excuse to your instructor.  Please notify me if you will be taking the make-up exam for the location of the testing site.

Links to old final exams and keys can be found on WA at the bottom of the list of links on the home page.  Calculators were allowed on those old finals, but are no longer allowed as of Spring 2014.

***
We will review for the final exam on Wed, April 20 and Wed, May 27 during class time by going over one of the old final exams and answering your other questions.

***
There are still a lot of points available to earn in this course.  Out of 600 points, Test 3 and the Retest are each worth 100 points and the final exam is worth 200 points.

You have worked hard this semester; finish strong!

At this point of the semester, many of you are tired, ill, and/or sleep deprived.  Consider your priorities and try to get your 8-9 hours of sleep each night.  Your brain needs it!

If you have any questions, issues, or concerns, please let me know.
