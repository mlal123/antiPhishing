Dear Professors,

We are from Women in Computer Science and we are having our first meeting
this Wednesday. Our goal is to not just attract women into pursuing a
computer science degree, but to also increase the retention rate of women
in computer science by providing them with a support system. We need help
promoting our first meeting, and we would really appreciate it if you could
help us get the word out to your students.

Thank you so much!

*Meet & Greet with Google Software Engineer Melanie Donny-Clark*

Hello from WiCS!

Do you want to learn new technologies and hang out with awesome girls? Do
you want to be in sync with cool CS opportunities? Come to UNC Women in
Computer Science's first meeting this Wednesday! You will have the
opportunity to hang out with Melanie Donny-Clark, a software engineer at
Google. Here is a little bit about her:

Melanie graduated from NYU with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and
went work as a Software Engineer at Google right after graduating. She
currently works on Google Maps on the Geo Data Infrastructure team,
building C++ servers and libraries to handle incoming geographic data. Her
team is based in New York but she mostly works out of the local office on
Franklin Street. She lives in Chapel Hill with her husband (a former
Googler) and her children. Melanie's hobbies include board games, Dungeons
& Dragons, crafts, 3D printing and partner acrobatics.


There will be an informal Q&A session with Melanie, so if you are
interested in learning more about how it's like to be a software engineer
at Google, please come! We are excited to see you!

Light refreshments will be provided.
