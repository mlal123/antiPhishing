Dear Diane,

Hope you are enjoying the new year!

I'm in product management at IBM working on an API management team in the
Cloud division here in RTP. My team is working on a variety of new launches
across our offering, including digital experience, documentation,
analytics, new product features, live chat, etc. over the next few months.
To make these launches as successful as possible, we are seeking feedback
from students with technical backgrounds who are able to participate in
user testing.

Can you please forward this email to your students? It would be great to
have students from UNC tell us about their experience with different sides
of our product as well as potential new launches of our product. We believe
this can be a fun opportunity for them too.

Students who fit the following description would be eligible to participate:

   - Technical background (computer science, electrical engineering, etc.)
   with some programming experience
   - Good to have basic knowledge of APIs, but no more than 1 year of
   experience working with APIs (beginner level only)

*Duration*: 1 hour
*Compensation*: $50
*Dates*: Mon, Jan 23; Tues, Jan 24; Wed, Jan 25

If interested in participating, please email me at Lana.Li@ibm.com by *Fri,
Jan 20 @ 5pm* with your availability on those days (slots are limited), and
I'll be in touch shortly.

Thank you so much!
