Hey gang I need ya'll to go and just agree to your roommate agreements (=
a lot of you have already done it but humor me and just check to make sure =
you've done it). Just copy and paste this link and it'll take you to your a=
greement page and all you have to
 do is agree to it, it'll take like 5 seconds. Thanks.
