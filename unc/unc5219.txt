Hey,
 
 I posted your "standings" after all three midterms, so let me just explain how to interpret that chart. First, I converted your scores on all three midterms into percentages of all points possible on the respective midterms. Then I dropped the lowest percentage and averaged the other two, since each of the midterms is going to have the same weight (15% of the final grade). So if your average percentage is 80, then that means you're getting 24% out of 30% possible from the midterms.
 
 If you missed one of the midterms, then I just averaged the other two so that I could plot something, but the final grade will be determined as discussed.
 
 Oh, and this is assuming that your final exam score (percentage-wise) is going to be better than the lowest midterm score, but I think that's pretty much a given.
