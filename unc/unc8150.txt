Hey Y’all, 
 
I hope that you are all staying warm. I have sent out 1-1 invites through outlook. I did make a small change in that instead of meeting once every three weeks for an hour, we will be meeting once every two weeks for 30mins. If we need to
 extend your time, we can chat about that during your 1-1s. This change really helps me when scheduling 34 1-1s that I will be doing this semester, so I appreciate you all working with me on this. However, some of you have still not filled out the availability
 form that I sent out a couple weeks ago. Please click the link below and fill that out by 9am tomorrow morning. Failure do so will result in you drawing duty at meeting on Monday evening. If you have an issue about having a 1-1 with me, please speak up and
 we can try and work together to make it all work. 
 
Please click the link to fill out your availability ASAP. Thanks.
