*Welcome back!  *Hope everyone is ready for the fall.  If you are new to
the department, I am the director of undergraduate studies.  I try to keep
my emails to academic and broad general topics.

I have had a hectic summer and am running rather late.  We will be setting
up advising hours soon and I will be clearing my inbox.  I appreciate your
patience.  Here is some breaking news on courses and a reminder open next
week's open house.

*A couple of new courses and notes:*

COMP 431: Internet Services and Protocols:  Please note that COMP 431 is
being offered this semester.  Prof Jeffay will be teaching it Monday and
Wednesday 4:40--5:55 and there are seats available

COMP 390-093: Digital Health Innovation Sprint.  UNC Health Care and School
of Medicine are running the Digital Health Innovation Sprint

this
semester.  I will be running a class for students interested in
participating.  Syllabus
 is posted.
Class will meet 5-7 on Wednesdays in SN 115.  First class will be an
information session and I will be registering students after the class
(permission is required).  COMP 426 is the basic prereq, but I am happy to
talk to students with experience but not the class.

COMP 782: Motion Planning in Physical & Virtual Worlds:  Prof. Alterovitz
has asked me to let Honors Program majors who have taken COMP 550 that he
would welcome your joining his class.  Please contact him directly.

*Open House:*
Mark your calendars for August 30 5-7 pm to hear what's new and exciting in
the department.  Details to follow.
