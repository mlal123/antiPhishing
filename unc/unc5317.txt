Maze Day!

asically an awesome morning of=
 activities (the maze, computer games, other interactive stations) put on by the UNC CompSci Department for people who are blind or vi=
sually impaired. This event is TONS of fun for both participants and the vo=
lunteers, so get excited! This year, Maze Day is on Wednesday, =
May 3rd. 
		
			 
		
			We =
NEED volunteers to help set up the maze on Tuesday, May 2nd. We will=
 have cardboard, tape, streamers, and other objects for you to use, but we =
also want you to use your imagination! The goal is to create a short maze f=
or participants to walk through. There will be ETC Officers there during se=
tup, so we will let you know the regulations and requirements once you get =
there. 
		
			 
		
			We recognize you all have final exams, and those are ve=
ry important. We want you to know though how much this day impacts the=
 lives of the kids who come in, and a simple hour of your time will go such=
 a long way in putting smiles on their faces! Please consider helping out a=
ny time during the day if you can, we really NEED you to get this done=
. Here is the Goog=
le doc for signing up (times may change depending on room/offic=

			Once again, we need your help! This is the biggest project (and one of t=
he only) of the Enabling Technology Club's first year at UNC, so please com=
e out and show some support. It doesn't have to be a crazy complicated, adv=
anced, and perfect maze, but it should definitely reflect some good effort.=
 It can also have some creative twists and turns! 
		
			
				Let me know if you =
have any questions or if you'd like to hear more about volunteering on Maze=
 Day itself, too.
