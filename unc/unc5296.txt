Hi CS majors!

Please take a moment to nominate a professor
 who teaches at least one
undergraduate class and that you believe is deserving of the "Teacher of
the Year" award! This award will be presented jointly by WiCS and CS Club
on behalf of all Computer Science undergrads. Deadline to submit a
nomination is this Sunday, April 30 at 11:59PM. Next week, you will receive
an email with a ballot to vote for a professor.

**You will need to login with your CS account to fill out the form! Also
please note, because Kris Jordan was the recipient last year, he will not
be on the ballot this year.

Thank you,
