We are very excited to announce that our data archive has been awarded a grant by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=23&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW1scy5nb3Yv&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
) as part of the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=23&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW1scy5nb3YvbmV3cy1ldmVudHMvbmV3cy1yZWxlYXNlcy9mZWRlcmFsLWludmVzdG1lbnRzLTEwLW1pbGxpb24td2lsbC1zdXBwb3J0LWxpYnJhcnktbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1hbmQtbW9kZWw%3D&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
). The grant will be used to support the development of an evidence-based training program for librarians and archivists focused on data curation for
reproducibility (Data CuRe).
Data CuRe is a collaborative project of the CURE Consortium, which includes the Odum Institute, the Institution for Social and Policy Studies at Yale
University (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=23&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cDovL2lzcHMueWFsZS5lZHUv&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions

). The training program is intended to equip its participants with the skills needed to ensure reproducibility of research data, the demand for which
has never been higher. From the grant abstract:

"...the knowledge and skills necessary to perform rigorous data curation that includes a code review component—essential to research
reproducibility—goes beyond the current expectations and abilities of most librarians and archivists.

A continuing education program targeting academic librarians and data archivists would offer opportunities for practitioners to augment current
expertise with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform intensive data curation tasks that support the research community’s demand for high
quality data and code."

Designing and Conducting Surveys of Businesses and Organizations with Diane Willimack and Chris Ellis

This course provides an overview of methodological issues associated with the use of surveys to collect data from organizations. We will identify key
differences between household surveys and organizational surveys, emphasizing organizational behaviors and attributes that affect survey response. 
We will demonstrate an approach to survey design that utilizes understanding and consideration of this organizational context when developing,
adapting, and implementing data collection instruments and procedures. This course will include topics related to survey planning, questionnaire
design and pretesting, data collection modes, and communication and response improvement strategies.
This course will count as 7.0 CPSM Short Course Credit hours.

Data Collection Using Mobile Phones in Developing Countries: New Approaches with SMS, IVR, and CATI

The rapid growth of mobile phones in developing countries opens up new possibilities for data collection. Short message service (SMS), interactive
voice response (IVR), online surveys (web) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) can produce data faster and less expensively than
face-to-face surveys. This course will introduce students to the design and implementation of SMS, IVR, Web, and CATI surveys in low- and
middle-income countries.
In this course, Dr. Lau will draw from real world examples to illustrate how these modes work. We will also discuss basic survey design principles in
each mode, focusing on sampling, questionnaire development, and survey design. New for this year’s course: Students will work in small groups to
design questionnaires and collect data in real time via SMS and IVR using a free, open source survey tool.
This course will count as 4.0 CPSM Short Course Credit hours.
