=A0=A0 =A0Inglorious Bastards was a great film, it was filled with action a=
nd some quality of humor. Like many Quinten Taratino movies, the film was f=
ull of gore, which I can handle =A0but didn=92t enjoy all too much. I was s=
quirming in some instances like at the end when Brad Pitt carved into Waltz=
=92s head or when Brad put his finger in the woman=92s gun wound. Those par=
ts really made me uncomfortable and all the scalp carving that they did in =
the film were also just as uncomfortable.   =A0=A0 =A0I thought Hans, the c=
haracter and the actor, was brilliant. His acting was superb and his charac=
ter was easily my favorite in the entire movie. Hans was a very smart and s=
hrewd character, that is most evident in the beginning scene where he deduc=
ted that the farmer actually had jews hiding under his house. All he did wa=
s talk the man into surrendering and outing himself, he didn=92t even resor=
t to torture or anything. I thought that was one of the most powerful scene=
s in the movie, I really enjoyed it. The confidence was just oozing out of =
Hans and he was so nonchalant about his whole process and it was comical an=
d awesome to watch him go to work. Later in the movie when Hans runs into S=
hoshana, was also another riveting moment for me. I thought he knew who she=
 was for sure when he ordered her milk, just a wonderful character and scen=
e. I can=92t say enough about christoph Waltz, great actor.  =A0=A0 =A0It c=
ertainly felt like there were a lot of one takes in the film, which was coo=
l to see. Most of them, coincidentally or not, had Hans in the scene (maybe=
 something to look into).   =A0=A0 =A0Overall I thought the movie was great=
. I really enjoyed watching it all even though it was rather full of gore. =
It was funny, especially when in the film Brad and his men tried to speak i=
n italian and it was blatantly obvious that they didn=92t know how; brad sa=
id french words with his very strong American southern accent. I found that=
 hilarious. I give the movie a solid 9/10.   =A0
