Prof Dewan's COMP 690 was listed as not counting toward the major.   This
has been clarified in Connect Carolina; this course can be counted toward
the major.  Not all COMP 690s will be acceptable for the major.  Do NOT
assume that they will without checking.

This COMP 690 requires that you have taken COMP 431 or COMP 530.  The
prerequisites WILL be checked and you will be unenrolled if you do not have
one of these courses.
