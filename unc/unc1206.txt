Dear Class:

Since classes are cancelled tomorrow (Fri, Jan 22), the Section 3.5 During-Class assignment has been reset and now due 5 minutes after class on Monday, Jan 25.  All other due dates referenced in the Week 2 email remain the same.  On Mon, Jan 25, we will cover Section 5.1 as planned.

During these events, ice and snow have fallen from the roofs of campus buildings.  Stay warm and safe!
