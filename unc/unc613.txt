Hello,
I hope you have a good Fall Break and are great to finish the semester strong. I write to touch base with you to see how classes and life is going for you. I also want to try to schedule
 a time to meet with you in the next two weeks – perhaps over a meal. 
 
Below are some dates, times and restaurant locations  to choose from  --- I will pay for our meal. If none of these times fit your
 schedule, do provide me 3-4 options of your availability between September 13 and September 18 (this includes Saturday and Sunday.) Again, if you are not available for lunch or dinner perhaps you can suggest a breakfast time (normally from 7:45 – 8:45 am at
 Ye Olde Waffle Shoppe on Franklin Street) or even a time for us to meet at the Daily Grind inside the Bookstore. We can also find a time to just meet me in my office.

 
Please respond by Thursday, October 29  regarding your availability and interest in meeting with me over a meal, remember it is on me.
