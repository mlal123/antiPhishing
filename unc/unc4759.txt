Hey Mangza,

It's going to depend on how well our section does on the final exam (compar=
ed to the other ones), but assuming the scores are roughly the same, an ave=
rage score here would get you around a B-.

Hey Andrej I just have a question, would the letter grade of the average=
 grade score be about a C? In other words,  if your exam grades are at=
 the average, would you expect to receive a C?
