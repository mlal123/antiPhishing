From: Dylan Glotzer (dglotzer) - dglotzer@live.unc.eduHello all,  (i) There is homework assigned today, although I have made it due Fri=
day. Based on the notes through today, you ought to be able to complete the=
 first 4 problems. The remaining 3 involve conditional probability (i.e. pr=
obabilities given=E2=80=8B something has occurred).  Note a=
lso that this material tends to be a bit tricky, so make sure to utilize of=
fice hours and the tutorial session if you need. I also am happy to an=
swer questions by email, although the timeliness of my response is som=
ewhat variable.  (ii) Note that the version of the textbook associat=
ed with WebAssign and the version that is posted on Sakai are slightly diff=
erent -- mainly that chapters are in a different order. The version on =
;Sakai was modified to be more in line with the course of our lecture notes=
 (e.g. chapter 3 is probability).  The syllabus follows the version on=
 Sakai.  As always, don't hesitate to let me know if you have questi=
ons.  Best,  DG ----------------------This forward=
