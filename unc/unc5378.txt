Good morning and happy Maze Day everyone!

There has been a change in location for t-shirt pickup and breakfast. You
can pick up your t-shirts, name tags, demo supplies, and breakfast in the
Entrepreneur's Lounge off of Sitterson Lower Lobby instead of on the
banquette behind the curved wall.

We are excited to see you all soon!

Best,
Hope
