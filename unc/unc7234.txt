1. Please do not contact Prof Jeffay with registration and enrollment
questions.  He is the chairman of the department and does not work on
individual problem.  If in doubt, come SEE me.  Coming to my office hours
is an infinitely more effective technique than emails.  While I have an
open door policy, that does NOT mean that you can interrupt an ongoing
meeting;  if I am talking to a student or students, wait until I finish.
2. We are adding COMP 475 (2D Graphics) to the spring schedule.  It will be
meeting 9:05-10:20 on Monday and Wednesday in SN011.  It should be posted
later today.
3. I have added seats to COMP 524.
4.  COMP 411-001 inadvertently left off the Friday lab.  I am working to
get it added to the schedule.  The lab will be Friday 1:25-2:15 in SN011.
This is NOT an optional lab.
5. If you want to register for any courses that require learning contracts
(internship, software engineering practicum, mentored research, independent
study, or honors research, please wait until the new forms and process are
posted next week.  I will only accept learning contracts *in person.*
Slipping them under my door or emails will be discarded.
