From: Lee Barnett (lbar) - lbar@live.unc.eduHey everyone,  &=
nbsp;  First off, congrats on making it through Midterm 2, it was pr=
etty tough. I understand that a lot of people are worried about their =
grade on that exam, and in the course overall, and I encourage yo=
u to get in contact with me if you have similar concerns. I would also like=
 to point out that the address you should use to email me is the one l=
isted in the syllabus-- lbarnett@cs.unc.edu-- since that's pretty much the =
only one I check regularly.      Second, and more i=
mportant, is that there have been some inconsistencies brought to my attent=
ion about scores in the Sakai gradebook. All the grades you =
have received are now visible to you on the Sakai site, so please make sure=
 that the scores recorded for you are correct (i.e. that they match the one=
s written by me or Oscar on your assignments). Most likely, the gradebook i=
s correct but it is a good idea for you to double check anyway. Send m=
e an email if there are any issues.     Lastly, there wi=
ll be a homework assignment announced today to be due next Wednesday in cla=
ss or Thursday in office hours, so be on the lookout for that later to=
day.     Lee ----------------------This forwa=
