Hey Daniel,


There's two quick things I should mention. I have German on Mon-Thurs morni=
ngs at 10, so the Tuesday and Thursday sessions won't really work. While I =
could technically do the Monday and Wednesday sessions, but I wouldn't be a=
ble to eat lunch until after 2:30, which I'd really rather not do. What sho=
uld I do?


Also, I currently don't have a white card to access the room.


Thanks,

Trey Hayes

Subject: Work Study Mentor Introduction

Hello Work Study members,

I have already met most of you in person, but for those I haven't, I'll int=
roduce myself. My name is Daniel Korn and I'm a BS/MS student with the UNC =
Computer Science Department. I've been given the opportunity to act as the =
Work Study program's mentor, which means I'm here to help you succeed with =
your projects. My main task to give you objectives on a weekly basis and he=
lp you accomplish deal with issues that come up along the way.

I want to give you guys access to myself and your other team members, so I'=
d like to have set hours for everyone to dedicate fully to their projects. =
These will be inside the Sitterson Software Systems Laboratory, at SN 136 (=
you'll need a white card to enter, I'm working on ensuring everyone access =
to this room right now).  These will be at

Monday: 12:30 - 2:30 PM
Tuesday: 9 - 11 AM
Wednesday: 12:30 - 2:30 PM
Thursday: 9 - 11 AM

To ensure everyone is able to make progress on their projects and get help =
when needed, at least two of these sessions should be attended every week.

In addition, I want to set aside time to have one on one meetings with each=
 of you on Friday. These are so we can discuss the goals and objectives of =
your project for the upcoming week. I have allotted 15-minute time slots fr=
om 12:45 until 4:00 each Friday. You can sign up for a time slot using this=

available for viewing under this email (dkorn@cs.unc.edu), so you can check and see when I'm free. If another time works bett=
er for you, I will do my best to make it happen. If you have any issues at =
all, let me know. If you have any ideas for your project or future projects=
 (new technologies, different systems, extra features, anything!) I'd be mo=
re than happy to hear them so we can work together to make use them. I hope=
 we all have a great semester.
