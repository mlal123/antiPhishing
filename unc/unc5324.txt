Hey,  I spoke about this a couple of times in class, but in case some of yo=
u aren't aware of it or forgot,=A0all three midterms (blank and with soluti=
ons)=A0from all of this term's sections are posted on Piazza. All instructo=
rs contributing buted questions to the final exam, so as far as practicing=
=A0problems=A0goes, this is probably the most representative of the final t=
hat you'll find (no finals from previous years are available). The question=
s will still be different, but=A0by going through those=A0midterms,=A0you'l=
l see other people's styles, too.  If=A0you actually take those at home and=
 then go through the solutions to check what your score would be, I can't r=
eally say what grade that would translate to, though, because every section=
 is different and I'm not sure what scores would get you, say, an A on that=
 particular exam.=A0I'm thinking at least 85 on all of them and probably 90=
=A0on the majority of them. Again, this doesn't apply to our section's midt=
erms.=A0But I'm just saying that so that you don't get complacent with prep=
aration if you're doing better on those, because I'd expect you to add 15-2=
5 percentage points to the scores you got on our midterms anyway (on the lo=
wer end for high scores, on the upper end for low scores). And what I mean =
by that is that, let's say you got 65% here and only ten people did better =
than you. Then you'd likely have to get 85% on those for only ten people to=
 be ahead of you. These are just rough estimates, =A0of course, but I just =
wanted to give you some idea about how to translate between scores.  Anyway=
, I hope this makes sense, but feel free to email me if you have any other =
questions. If you have any questions on midterm problems, please post them =
on Piazza first, though.
