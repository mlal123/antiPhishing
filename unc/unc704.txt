Please do not contact Jade Barricelli about academic issues.  She can not
help you.  It takes her time and delays getting you the help you need.  For
academic issues, you can contact any of the advisers: me, Prof Bishop, Prof
Baruah, or Prof Mayer-Patel.  If you just need one of us, we can all be
contacted through cs-advising-cs@cs.unc.edu.  If you need to see an
adviser, the calendar is at the bottom of the undergraduate program page
.  If there are no appointments
left, please see someone during walk-in hours.

My apologies to those of you for whom this is repeated information.  I know
that I have sent out several emails relating to this.
