Hi Mangza,


That is not required for this paper. I just suggested it as a way of hel=
ping you get started.


PS, I saw that your email was sent at 2:58am - I hope you'll have a chan=
ce to get some rest over the break!

Okay yeah, my initial thought was three verses with a refrain but that t=
empo change (the second part of the verse) really threw me off and I though=
t that could be a pre-chorus which would change the song form. Thanks for t=
he clarification!

Hi Mangza,


I could accept a couple different interpretations of the song form, but =
I hear an AABA song form with a refrain text carrying over into the outro (=
2 lines). The verses are pretty long (if you accept this interpretation), a=
nd each has 3 parts. The final part
 is the refrain, "Viva las Vegas." The part right before this cha=
nges, where the melody and rhythm change, is the second part of the verse.<=
/p>


I could also see a "pre-chorus" interpretation (verse-pre-chor=
us-chorus), but that makes less sense to me since normally a pre-chorus rep=
eats with the same music and text. In this case, the part you mentioned whe=
re the music changes has different text every
 time. Therefore, I think you can make a better argument for AABA.


Does that help clarify the situation?

Hey professor so I'm just having trouble determining the form for Elvis'=
 "Viva Las Vegas" and I was hoping you could clear up some confus=
ion for me. So initially I thought it would just be a simple verse structur=
e with just repeating refrain of "Viva Las
 Vegas". But then there's the part right before he sings out "Viv=
a Las Vegas", the beat and rhythm changes and it seems like it could k=
inda be like a pre-chorus and the "Viva las Vegas" part acting as=
 the chorus but I wasn't sure. Could you clear up this confusion
 for me? You don't have to directly tell me if that's not something you wan=
t to do but could you just maybe clear up the confusion of how to judge a p=
re-chorus and refrain versus chorus?
