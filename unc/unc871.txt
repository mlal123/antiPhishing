As the semester wraps up, we know that students want to use space in the
building for work sessions, study groups, and interview calls.  This is a
reminder about the use of these rooms.

   - If you are "squatting" in a room that you have not reserved and
   someone with the room reserved comes in, you must vacate the space.  This
   means that you should not be using a room for an interview unless you know
   that you will not be evicted.
   - You can check whether a room is being used by checking the google
   calendar.  http://cs.unc.edu/calendars/ has the list of calendars that
   you should be checking.
   - Students cannot reserve rooms.  When you click the room on the side of
   the calendar, that sends an invitation to the room calendar but it is NOT
   automatically accepted and hence the room is not reserved.
   - The only way to reserve a room in the building is through a faculty
   member.  If you are reserving a room for a club, you should work with the
   faculty adviser for the club.  If you are working on a project for a
   faculty member or are arranging a study group for a class, ask the faculty
   member to reserve the room.  They will know how to do it.

We encourage students to spend time in Sitterson and Brooks.  We just want
to make sure that everyone respects the commitments made for the resources.

Have a good semester end!
