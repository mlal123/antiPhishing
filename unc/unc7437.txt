Hey Uyi here's my resignation letter,
 
Hello my name is Mangza Lal, currently a Resident Adviser at Morrison Residence Hall. Unfortunately I will have to resign my position as a Resident Adviser because I have been accepted to the Burch
 Silicon Valley program. This means that in the Spring of 2018, I will have the opportunity to work at a start-up in Silicon Valley while I finish my Entrepreneurship minor for the semester. This is an opportunity that I do not want to pass up. I am resigning as
 a Resident Adviser at the end of this semester, Fall 2017.
