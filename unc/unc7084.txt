1. HackNC is this weekend.  For more information see https://hacknc.com/

2. Registration begins next week.  Please make sure that you have holds
removed BEFORE your registration slot.  Any advisor can remove the hold.
Our walk-in office hours are on the advising calendar
.
     I will be handling registration problems such as needing to override
prerequisites and courses that require department consent.  I have office
hours 8-9 most mornings and will be adding additional hours at the end of
the day. They will be posted on the advising calendar, but remember that I
can't do anything until after your registration time. While I am happy to
help you at non-office hours if there is no one in my office, please do NOT
interrupt student meetings.
