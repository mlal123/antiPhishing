My name's Will, and I'm working on a consulting project at the
Kenan-Flagler business school focusing on data science and economic
development in North Carolina.  As part of our project, we're hosting a
focus group of Computer Science students to learn more about perceptions of
data science and related industries in NC, career opportunities in data
science, and what factors affect your decision-making in selecting a career
in data science.  We will ask brief questions about these topics and give
you the opportunity respond in an open-ended fashion, in a group of no more
than 10 students.  Your input will help us make recommendations to the
government of North Carolina on how to improve data science education in NC
and how to leverage NC's data science industry for economic development.

The focus group will take place Wednesday, April 13, at 6:15pm in Union
3502.  The session will take less than one hour, and food and beverages
from a local restaurant will be provided.   If you would like to attend,
please fill out the form provided:

If you plan to attend, please sign up before the weekend if possible, so
that we will have some idea of how many attendees to plan for.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at my phone or
email listed below.

Many thanks,
