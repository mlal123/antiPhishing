Hello Everyone,

*Carolina Scientific *is UNC's premier research magazine written, designed,
and edited by undergrads and we're looking to recruit new members for our
fall issue. Come check out one of our interest meetings on *Wednesday
August 26th* or *Thursday August 27th*, both at *8 pm* in *Dey 307*. We'll
talk about all the different ways to get involved with the magazine,
including writing, designing, blogging, and digital content. Hopefully we
can help hone your writing skills, learn some science, and get you
published in our magazine by the end of the semester!

For questions, email majmudar@live.unc.edu.

Look forward to seeing you soon!

Editor-in-Chief, *Carolina Scientific*
