Hi everyone,

We came around and chatted with some of you a little earlier about signing
up to demo or volunteer at the Science Expo on Saturday, April 22. If you
have anything you could show, we would really appreciate you signing up to
demo. If you are available to help but don't have a demo, we could use
volunteers too! We are expecting more than 800 people and want to show the
department in a good light.


Sign up to demo here! 
Sign up to volunteer here! 

As a premature thank you, we have cookies in SN131 - please come grab one!

Best,
Hope
