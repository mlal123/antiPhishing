2017 ACCOUNTING FIRM TREK TO RALEIGH FEBRUARY 17 9AM-5PM
FIELD TRIP!!! For the second straight year, the accounting club is going on=
 office tours of Raleigh accounting firms. This year we have a great lineup=
 of firms including Deloitte, EY, Grant Thornton, and DHG. The trek is a wo=
nderful opportunity to meet accountants outside of the classroom setting an=
d see what their office culture is actually like. Students will also positi=
on themselves greatly for leadership conferences and internships! The plan =
is to leave the Kenan-Flagler parking lot by 9am, and visit Deloitte for a =
morning visit. EY will host us for a COMPLIMENTARY lunch, then we'll close =
out our afternoon with afternoon visits to Grant Thornton and DHG. We only =
have a limited number of spots for UAC members! The committee can only carp=
ool 8-10 members who can't drive or have transportation. Another 12-15 spot=
s are available for members who can drive themselves and others. Members wh=
o have attended the most meetings this year get preference for spots. Not m=
any students get the opportunity to visit these offices, so I strongly enco=
urage you to take advantage of this chance. Please mark your calendars, and=
