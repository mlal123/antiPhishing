From: Dylan Glotzer (dglotzer) - dglotzer@live.unc.eduHello all,  Unfortunately, I can't make my normal office hours today (1:45pm-2:45pm).  I apologize for the short notice--to make up for it, I will have time during that hour and later this afternoon to answer emails if you have questions about the homework.  Additionally, I will be available in my office before class tomorrow, 8:30am - 10:00am.  Also: reminder that the homework is not due tomorrow, it's due Monday. You may be able to answer some or all of the questions on the homework already, but we will go over some examples to make things more clear.  Best,  DG ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "STOR155.001.FA16" site.
