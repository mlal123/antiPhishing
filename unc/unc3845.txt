From: Dylan Glotzer (dglotzer) - dglotzer@live.unc.eduHello all,  Just a reminder that there is a Q/A review session tonight from 6-7pm.  Additionally, it has been pointed out to me that I made an error in the solutions to the practice exam problems 1(a) and 1(g). A fixed version has been uploaded. Let me know if you have any questions about it.  Best,  DG ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "STOR155.001.FA16" site.
