lease note the following:    EXAM TIME/LOCATION     The=
 Unit III/Final Exam is scheduled for Saturday, Dec 9 from 12:00pm-2:30p=
m (Haynes Auditorium).   I will proctor one alternate s=
ession for students who have conflicting exam times or who have three final=
s in a 24-hour period. That has tentatively been scheduled for Sunday, D=
ec 10 from 12:00pm-2:30pm (location: TBD). Please let me know if you ne=
ed to take the exam at the alternate time.      EXAM CON=
TENTS and STRUCTURE; STUDY MATERIALS     With the exception of two =
(out of three) essays, the entirety of the exam is based on content from Un=
it III. The exam is longer than exams I-II but follows the same format.   A Unit III/Final Exam Study Materials folder has been uploaded to S=
akai --> Resources. The listening guide will be updated on Tuesday follo=
wing the lecture.      CHAPTER QUIZZES     I hav=
e reopened the chapters 10-11 quizzes. While you can no longer earn EC for =
chapter 10, this will allow you to get feedback on your responses for study=
 purposes.   Several people "missed the boat" on the cha=
pter 11 quiz (due right after the break). I'll accept both chapters =
11-12 through Tuesday, Dec 5 (midnight), without penalty - I recommend agai=
nst trying to finish both quizzes plus paper #4 on the same day. :)  <=
