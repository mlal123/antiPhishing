Starting Friday, May 18, 2018, the One Card Office will no longer offer the UNC One Card Plus, the instant-issue Wells Fargo Visa Debit card which also operated as a University ID. All current UNC One Card Plus cards will still be valid
 until the expiration date listed on the card. 
Students, faculty and staff now have the option of a University ID from the One Card office and a separate debit card from Wells Fargo Bank. This separate, co-branded UNC Debit Card is now available for all current students, faculty and
 staff. Each student, faculty and staff member will continue to receive a One Card as their University ID.

The UNC Debit Card will only be available from a Wells Fargo Bank for Wells Fargo account holders. For more information about the benefits of the UNC Debit Card, visit
