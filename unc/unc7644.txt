From: McNair Mitchener (mcnairhm) - mcnairhm@live.unc.eduHi Teams,<=
/p>  In order to receive your final project grade, we require ea=
ch member of every team complete a peer review form which you can =
find here:  https://goo.gl/forms/2lG5oWsI8hw8t4Jr2  This allows=
 us to make sure we are evaluating teams fairly, as not all members are nec=
essarily to earn the same grade. If your whole team does not complete this form by Sunday ev=
ening at 5PM, you are subject to lose points on your project grade=
 overall. It is a very quick form, so go ahead and knock it out!=
  We are looking forward to seeing everyone in class tomorrow for our fi=
nal pitch bake off. To the teams pitching, good luck!  MHM  &=
