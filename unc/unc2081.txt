Folks,

Here's an opportunity to hone your skills in using technology to solve
business problems while possibly earning some money and landing some
interviews.  The competition starts during the summer and finishes up in
September (before crunch time starts).  This is design only -- no coding.

We are looking to put forward a team of 5-6 students to represent UNC.  (We
can have more than one team if we have a lot of interest.)  And, yes, you
can join in remotely during the summer!  You should register if you are
interested, but I think that the best way to get this started is for you to
let me know that you are interested and I will connect those interested.

Here are the details:

IASA Raleigh (IASA is an international association of IT architects) is
hosting the IASA ITARC Southeast  IT
Architecture Conference in the Raleigh Convention Center September 23rd. As
part of the conference, there will be a track called the "Student
Architecture Showdown"

   1. IASA pairs a group of 5-6 students from a local university with a
   professional mentor.  (*June 10* deadline to commit.)
   2. *June 24* is a kickoff for all groups and mentors.
   3. You are presented a real world business problem on *July 8*.
   4. The students, with the guidance of their mentors, create
   architectures to solve the business problem.
   5. Final student submissions are due *September 8*.
   6. At the conference (*September 23*), the students present their
   architectures.
   7. A panel decides the winning group of students (same day).
   8. The winning group gets a *cash prize* and *guaranteed interviews* with
   tech companies in the area.
