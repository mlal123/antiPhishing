Hi everyone,
=20
 I realized that in class I mixed up theta and phi when I was giving the fo=
rmula for the triple integral in spherical coordinates. The factor inside o=
f that integral should be rho^2 sin(phi), not rho^2 sin(theta), so like in =
the last example that we did. Sorry about the mix-up!  =A0
