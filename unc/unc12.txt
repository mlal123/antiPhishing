Please read the Frequently Asked Questions below BEFORE contacting our office about yo=
ur assignment.
 
Q1. Why wasn=92=
t I assigned to one of my top choice halls?
A. Each year, we assign approximately 3200 first-year stu=
dents to our 8 on-campus residence halls that offer the First Year Experien=
ce. Within these halls, we also house the First-year Honors Carolina studen=
ts together, the Carolina Millennial Scholars (CMSP) and Chancellor=92s Sci=
ence Scholars (CSS) programs, an all-female hall, and the Service & Lea=
dership, UNITAS, and Spanish House Residential Learning Programs (RLPs).  With all of these programs to =
consider, it is unfortunately impossible to assign every student to their t=
op choice.
 
Q2. Can I chang=
e my room assignment?
A. All assigned students will have the opportunity to mak=
e changes to their assignments during the Room Refinement period, which wil=
l take place from July 1-31. We will send an email reminder with further in=
structions later in June. A few weeks after Fall move-in, we also allow stu=
dents to request room changes if they find that their room/roommate situati=
on is not meeting their needs. Your Community Director will provide you wit=
h more information about this process.
 
Q3. What if I m=
eet someone over the Summer and would rather room with them than with my as=
signed roommate?
A. Provided that neither of you are in a special program =
that requires you to live in/on a certain hall/floor, you may politely cont=
act your currently-assigned roommates and ask if one of them wouldn=92t min=
d switching with one of you. Please be aware that they are not obligated=
 to do so. If they do agree, both students switching should email h=
ousing@unc.edu.
