Happy 2nd day of class!!! It's hard to believe the fall semester is behind
us already and we are ready to jump into Spring recruiting season starting
NEXT WEEK! Please be reminded that this listserv is your source for all
things related to gaining experience for your eventual career whether that
be employer visits to campus, career fairs and networking events, job and
internship opportunities, and workshops that will help you prepare for the
job and internship search. Each week I will send out "the big one" that
outlines what is coming up next week, the near future, and any
communications that employers request that I share directly with you.
Remember though, most opportunities just get posted to Careerolina
 so make it a point
to check it regularly and if you need help navigating the system, come see
me! (Sitterson 121 on T&W)

We have a good lineup of employers coming to campus this semester and you
can always use the calendar found on http://cs.unc.edu/career/ to view
career related events and RSVP. Please be reminded of being respectful of
the RSVP system. If you plan to attend, RSVP, if you are unsure, don't RSVP
until you can commit to be there. It never looks good when I tell an
employer a number and only half show up. You all have an awesome reputation
to uphold! So without further ado...The BIG one!

*Analytical Developer | Local Contact Job*

Looking for a student with strong problem-solving skills that enjoys
learning Objective-C.  I have an iOS app on the App Store, so it's already
designed and built.  I want to offer a motivated developer an opportunity
to learn my app's code for experience and help with *bug fixes for pay*.
I'll pay on a contract basis. I'm a UNC alumnus in the Chapel Hill area
that graduated a few years ago, and I hired an offshore team to build the
prototype for me. The major issues with the app are currently with a 1-on-1
messaging feature built with CometChat
, if
interested. I designed the app myself (but I don't code), so I'm very
hands-on and engaged.  I'll be working closely with you, however I'm
looking for a highly-skilled developer capable of both autonomy and
leadership/managing a team - this is for *expert iOS developers only*.
