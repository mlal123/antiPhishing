Each year the department awards a "TA of the Year of the Award" to a grad
student or undergrad who has been a TA in the current academic year (that's
2015-2016).  The award is funded by an alum (John Glotzer) who was a TA himself
while here and since went on to fame and fortune (now at Amazon).  Thus, we
treat this as a big deal.

So, I hereby solicit nominations for the TA of the year.  If you had a TA you
liked/loved (or just didn't hate) this past school year, please fill
in the google
form  to nominate them.  It's not hard:
 all I ask for is a name and a sentence.

Nominations are due by midnight at the end of the month (Saturday, April 30)

Let the voting begin!
