8217;t mean you can walk over to your opponents to see what they’re d=
oing. Who does that?
			
			
				
					<=
span style=3D"color: rgb(255, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space:=
 pre-wrap;">Be respectful of the venue -- We like the CS department and apprec=

					<=
span style=3D"color: rgb(255, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space:=
