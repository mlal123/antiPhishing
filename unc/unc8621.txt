15th Annual Qualitative Research Summer Intensive

It's that time again! We're gearing up for this year's Qualitative Research Summer Intensive, the annual 5-day short course series we cosponsor with
ResearchTalk, Inc. (

)
Join us for five days of qualitative research professional development courses and networking opportunities, and take advantage of this unique chance
to gain both theoretical and practical understanding of qualitative inquiry. 
For its fifteenth year, the Intensive has added seven new courses and one new instructor. As always the course list offers a wide range of qualitative
research topics, so you can tailor your schedule to best suit your needs and interests.
The QRSI team strives to provide courses that will help keep you on the cutting edge of your field, taught by world-class instructors - many of whom
literally wrote the book on their topics.
