 and helped us recruit!


Just a couple quick things for you all before I add the names and send you =
all another email ;)


First, dues this year are still $50. ** but we have a great way to raise mo=
ney for the club and reduce dues!  Club Sports wants us to sell discount ca=
rds for $10.  For every one you sell, we will cut $10 off of your dues. So,=
 you can sell 5 of these cards and be set with dues for the year!


Practice times are still Mon/Thurs from 6pm-9pm.  We will also have Saturda=
y 10am-noon and Sunday 5pm-7pm for those wanting to play more singles.

en gym schedule has not been set yet, but I will let you know when that hap=
pens.


Two of our tournament dates are set in stone-- September 29-October 1st her=
