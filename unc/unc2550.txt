*Tips To Prepare For The Career Fairs & Symposium:*


   - *Use the links provided above to view the list of employers who will
   be attending the Job and Internship Expo and Tech Fair. *
      - Make decisions about who you want to talk to that day and create a
      spreadsheet of those employers to take with you.
      - Include:
         - Name of company
         - Job or internship you are interested in learning more about
         - Skills the employer is looking for
         - A question you have for the recruiter. For example:
            - *Can you tell me about some projects that past interns have
            worked on?*
            - *What skills and qualities are most important when making
            hiring decisions for [insert job title of interest]*
            - *I've submitted my application on your website. Can you tell
            me about next steps?*
         - *Practice your 30 second pitch and communication strategy.*
      - Smile, make eye contact and extend your hand.
      - Introduce yourself giving the recruiter your name, major, and year
      (Sophomore, Junior, Etc)
      - Mention what opportunity you are interested in and some skills and
      experiences you bring to the table that relate.
      - Ask them your prepared question based on the research you did
      beforehand.
      - Be sure not to monopolize their time (pay attention to the line
      behind you), thank them for the information, give them your
resume and ask
      for a business card in case you have follow-up questions.
   - *Follow-up via email with recruiters a day or two after the event. *
      - Remind them where you met.
      - Thank them again for the information they provided about [insert
      position your interested in].
      - Reiterate your interest and fit for the role.
      - You can ask a question if you have one or update them on your
      application. Perhaps between the time you talked you submitted your
      application via careerolina. Let them know that and tell them
that if they
      need any further information from you in order to make decisions
about your
      candidacy, to reach out.
      - Tell them that you look forward to hearing from them.
