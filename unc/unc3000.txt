Hi all -

Just to clarify, you will need to complete the training in the highlighted
section below by Friday, October 21st.  It will take about 30 minutes so
plan accordingly.  At the end of the training, there will be a certificate
of completion.  Please print and sign this certificate and bring to either
myself or Missy Wood.  Please let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks,
