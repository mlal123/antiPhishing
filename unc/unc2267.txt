From: Logan Tatham (ltatham) - ltatham@live.unc.eduHello Class,=
  I just wanted to send another email reminding everyone about the final=
 exam, which is on Monday at 8:00 AM =
;in the classroom. It is more heavily weighted towards the material we have=
 done since the second exam, but will also include material going all the w=
ay back to the beginning of the course. Besides the material we've covered =
in this class, I will assume a knowledge of the same things I assumed on th=
e first exam. I've copied and pasted what those things are here:    The unit circle a=
nd trigonometric identities (including the half-angle formulas for sin^2(x)=
,cos^2(x))  Algebra (especially factoring, expanding, rules of log=
arithms)  Material from calculus 1, especially u-substitution and =
basic derivatives/integrals  (a table of these are on the reference pag=
es in the back of your book. I expect you to know Differentiation Rules 1-2=
4 on Reference Page 5 and items 1-18 of the table of integrals (maybe just =
letting a=3D1 in 16, 17, and 18))   If I ask you a question on=
 remainder estimates of series or of arc length of a curve, I will give you=
 the formulas for those. Everything else should be memorized. You'll also n=
eed to be able to recognize and identify a Taylor Series from the tabl=
e in Section 11.10 consisting of the 7 standard Taylor Series. I won't ask =
you to write them down from memory, but I will ask you to identify them via=
 a matching/true false/multiple choice question (so then you can use t=
hat question for reference throughout the rest of the exam ).<=
/p>  I wish you all the best of luck studying. I've really enjoyed teach=
ing the material and getting to know you all. Please don't hesitate to reac=
h out to me if you have any questions (and I mean that- I'm not saying that=
 out of obligation). Also please fill out the teaching evaluation surv=
ey that was sent out to you.  Logan ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from =
