From: Megan Eagen (galileo) - galileo@email.unc.eduFolks,  Thanks again for your focus and engagement in today's class.  Please be reminded that, in lieu of a chapter quiz, the shared writing for chapter 10 is due tonight. The chapter 10 quiz may be completed for EC.*  *I received several reports that the quiz is unavailable to some students, and I have reported this issue to our Pearson tech support person. We should have this corrected shortly (no later than tomorrow), but in light of the problem, I will accept EC quizzes through Tuesday, Nov 21.  Have a great weekend,  Dr. E-J ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "MUSC143.001.FA17" site.
