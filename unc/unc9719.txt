Hey gang,


This is just a reminder that no personal trash should be going into the bat=
hroom trash cans. The responsibility of keeping the bathroom clean is every=
one's responsibility. The garbage for our building is right outside, by the=
 stairs, so please refrain from throwing any of your personal trash in the =
bathroom trashes. Also, someone has been filling up the first toilet with p=
aper towels and this is not acceptable. Please be mindful of the housekeepi=
ng staff that clean for us and let's not make their work any more difficult=
. Hopefully this problem will not persist going forward otherwise housing w=
ill be charging everyone on our entire floor for a cleaning fee.


Thanks,
