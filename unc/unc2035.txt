Dear Diane and Rob,
I got your contact from Chad Mark Haefele. I am organizing the Game UX
summit on May 12 at The Durham Convention center (see information below)
and can offer a few free student tickets if your students are interested (I
have 10 free tickets remaining, first come for serve).

I need to know by tomorrow though. They can reach out to me directly. Sorry
for the short notice but I was pretty swamped organizing everything :).

Let me know if you're interested.
Thanks!
Celia
