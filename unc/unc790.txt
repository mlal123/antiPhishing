Hey Guys!

As everyone is aware we are always strapped for cash and (although we have =
done well working football games) the hotel costs are catching up to us. In=
 order to cover this trip's hotel we will need everyone attending the tourn=
ament to bring an extra $10.  For those of you on the team last year, you m=
ay remember paying quite a bit more than that for more than just one hotel =
stay last year.  This year we almost had it covered! :-)

Also please give your drivers (those of you not in the van) a few bucks for=
 gas as well.  Driving the 2.5 hr to Liberty sucks (speaking from experienc=
e) and car's do not magically fill up with gas. (However, when they do fill=
 up with gas make sure you do it in VA, soooo cheap!).  I'd also like to re=
commend that whoever gets to sit shotgun in all vehicles is responsible for=
 keeping the driver awake - this is a rule in my car Matt, Jackson, Anton. =
:-)  I have a feeling this is going to be a late Sunday night drive back to=
 Chapel Hill, so be courteous and don't just sleep the entire time, or your=
 drivers may just fall asleep too....think about that! :-P

Everyone get your homework done early!

Get ready to spend our LAST weekend in Liberty for the year (YAY!).
