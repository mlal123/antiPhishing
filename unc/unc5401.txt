From: Andrej Duh (duh) - duh@live.unc.eduHey,  Some of you extended your homework past May 3, 11:59 PM, which I said would be the last deadline, and got automatic extensions for as late as 9 PM today. I need to cut those to 2:59 PM, so please finish by then, because this needs to be due before the exam and there can be no more extensions. ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "MATH233.001.SP17" site.
