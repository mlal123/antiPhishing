COMP 390 How to Build a Software Startup
Spring 2016, T/TH 9:30 - 10:45am
Professor: Michael Fern
From this course, you will develop real-world, hands-on experience to
successfully develop and launch a software startup. You will work in teams
and each team will be paired with an experienced startup founder as a
mentor. The course will apply a flipped classroom approach, where
the lecture will be viewed on your own time via video. You will also spend
considerable time outside of the classroom engaging with potential
customers to develop a business model and minimum viable product. A minimum
viable product is the smallest product or service that can be
deployed to provide potential value to a set of early customers. Our time
together in-class will be spent sharing ideas and advice, interacting with
guest speakers, discussing startup case studies, and working together on
the course deliverables. The ultimate goal of the course is to help you
develop a product or service that provides value; i.e., a product that
customers will actually want to use and buy!

I hope to see you in the course! If you have any questions, please don=E2=
