A competitive programming lecture series will be held on campus starting
next Monday, January 23rd. These meetings will provide you a chance to
practice your problem solving skills while learning about new data
structures and algorithms. We think that there will be something for
everyone, regardless of whether they are interested in competing in next
year's ACM-ICPC, strengthening their problem solving ability for
interviews, or simply expanding their algorithmic toolkit. The lectures
will be held in FB007 on Mondays from 5 to 7 PM. The attached PDF describes
the meeting format and contains a list of the topics we aim to cover. We
hope to see you there! - Saujas Nandi and Yicheng Wang"
