From: Eric Thomas (ehthomas) - ehthomas@live.unc.eduHello Anthropol=
ogy Enthusiasts,  After some careful deliberation, I have decided to=
 cancel recitations this week in favor of a single, optional review=
 session to be held on Wednesday from 11:15 am -12:05 pm in Alumni Hall 205=
.    What this means: Wednesday's 4:40 and Fri=
day's 2:30 recitations are effectively canceled.  Students in=
 those sections should feel free to attend the review session after lecture=
 on Wednesday (tomorrow) but are under no obligation to do so.  I will=
 try to accommodate as many students as show up.  I am not preparing=
 any materials for the review session.  You will be expected t=
o come with questions (about content, not about the format of the exam and =
definitely not about your grade in the course thus far) which=
 I will answer to the best of my ability.  Lastly, I would like=
 to personally encourage all of you to complete course evaluat=
ions for both the lecture and your recitation.  This helps th=
e instructor and TAs to know what we're doing well, where we need to i=
mprove, and what content works best.  To this end, your feedback =
is always useful and appreciated.    Cheers,  Eric <=
