FROM GOOGLE:

Greetings! We would like to invite you to an exclusive *YouTube Live event
with Jeff Dean from Google=E2=80=99s Brain Team!*

*Jeff Dean* will be talking about some of the work being done on the Brain
team at Google, and will discuss the Google Brain Residency Program for
2017.

*What's YouTube Live?? *
YouTube Live is a new interactive platform that we are excited to share
with you. It's just like watching a YouTube video, except the event is
filmed live and you can tune in and post questions via chat to the
presenters in real time. This also means you have to tune in at the time of
the event to watch, so don=E2=80=99t miss out! We sincerely hope to see you=
 all
there.

*What Is The Brain Residency Program??*
The Google Brain Residency Program is a one-year intensive residency
program focused on Deep Learning. Residents will have the opportunity to
conduct cutting-edge research and work alongside some of the most
distinguished deep learning scientists within the Google Brain team. To
learn more about the team and what we do, visit g.co/brain.

The application for the program opens on September 1st (the same day as our
YouTube Live event), and we encourage you to apply! The ideal candidate
should have a degree (BS, MS, or PhD) or equivalent practical experience in
a STEM field such as Computer Science, Mathematics, or Statistics. Current
students would need to graduate before the Residency begins. Candidates
should present evidence of proficiency in programming (preferably in Python
or C++) and in prerequisite courses. Most importantly, we are looking for
candidates who are hardworking, motivated and have a strong interest in the
field of machine learning and deep learning research!

and
see what materials to prepare (application opens onSeptember 1st). We will
be accepting applications until January 13th, 2017, interviewing candidates
in February 2017 and notifying candidates if they have been accepted by
April 2017. The anticipated start date will be in July 2017.
