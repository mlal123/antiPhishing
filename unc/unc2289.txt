Hi eve=
ryone, 




I hope=
 this email finds you well and enjoying what's left of a Summer break that =
went way by way too fast.  I spoke with the Comp Sc=
i department about an opportunity and I'm emailing
 to give you some information and see if anyone is interested.


My name is Julian and I am leading the developme=
nt of a venture that helps to connect people with others to support the ach=
ievement of their physical fitness goals. Often a person would like to go t=
o the gym or work towards improving
 their physical fitness but they don't for a range of reasons. These includ=
e not wanting to go to the gym alone, moving to a new place and losing thei=
r fitness network, being unsure of how to perform exercises, or not knowing=
 how to develop a fitness plan for
 their specific goals. Some people do begin but eventually give up on their=
 fitness goals due to life commitments or not having a support system. This=
 is the genesis of my idea.



I am developing an app (and a companion website)=
 that allows you to create a profile and list your fitness level (beginning=
, intermediate, advanced...and more information) and help connect you to ot=
hers that are also looking for fitness
 support. This is accomplished through smartphone GPS technology (so someth=
ing like Uber but developed for fitness).  Additional functionality in=
cludes a feature for people that are already pretty active looking for othe=
rs with whom they can train (e.g. runners,
 Tough Mudders, bikers, etc). The feature allows you to broadcast events th=
at you create such as pick up games of basketball, etc and others can join.




I was fortunate to have gotten my start in 
entrepreneurship at Carolina (and NCSSM) and to have used that start=
 to lead ventures to success (e.g. Nominated for 2012 White House Champions=
 for Change Award, Inducted into UNC's Order of the Golden Fleece, Awarded =
the 2013 Emerging Issues Prize for
 Innovation, Awarded 2013 Triangle Business Journal Top 40 Under 40 Entrepr=
eneur award, etc).


As we prepare for launch (the end of the month), I'm looking for a couple m=
embers to join our tech team (also UNC students, so it's a fun team). I'm s=
pecifically interested in help with the iOs App development, but open to he=
aring from all skill sets. We have
 secured some huge partnerships with UNC, and this is your chance to be a p=
art of the creation and launch of technology that will change how people co=
nnect and think about fitness.




If you are interested, please email me at julian=
_wooten@med.unc.edu AND julian.wooten@gmail.com (I get a lot of emails so I=
 want to be sure that I receive it). 


I look forward to hearing from you and potential=
ly working together.
