From: Logan Tatham (ltatham) - ltatham@live.unc.eduHello class,=
  I just wanted to write and let you know that I have curved the grades =
for the first exam, and the new scores are now in gradebook. I didn't use a=
 linear scale, so it would be easiest for you to just go to gradebook and s=
ee your new score. If you have concerns about the way I curved it, let me k=
now.  I want to be the best teacher I can be to you all, so I have c=
reated a short survey for you to fill out to give me some feedback on =
how I can be the best instructor possible. This is anonymous, but please an=
swer in a way that will be the most helpful to me, rather than in a way tha=
t only tells me that you're angry/frustrated- knowing this would be helpful=
, but voicing it in a tactful way would help me much more than just angry r=
esponses. Also keep in mind that the difficulty and pacing of the course is=
 intrinsic to the course material and the fact that it's a summer semester,=
 but I still want to do as much as I can to present the material as easily =
as possible. The survey is optional, but would be very helpful for me, the =
class, and you as an individual. You may access the survey here: http:=

ow for a bit of philosophy of math, if you're interested (not testable). In class yesterday, to motivate the concept of infinite=
 series, we saw that our notation of writing down the real numbers depends =
on the fact that every real number can be written as an infinite decimal;&n=
bsp;i.e., as an infinite series of the form a_n/10^n. Some may consider it =
lucky that this is the case, because it means we discovered a useful way of=
 notating the real numbers. Others think there is no luck to it- it is that=
 we created the real numbers, or at least have an invent=
ed concept of them in our minds, and we created them as the set of all sums=
 of infinite series with rational terms. In this second school of thought, =
the discovery was not that we found a nice way to notate them, it's that we=
 discovered that the "real" numbers aren't "real" at al=
l, but a concept we've constructed in our mind, and we finally discovered h=
ow we've defined them without realizing it.  Thin=
k about that and how often that happens in life. When we discover a truth- =
in philosophy, science, or otherwise- how often is the "truth" so=
me Platonic truth that exists somewhere "out there" that we found=
, or are we only finding a concrete way to define or arrive at what we've b=
een seeing all along? Then again, there's got to be something out there we'=
re basing these truths on. If the real numbers, for example, is just a conv=
enient construct based on rational numbers, where do the rational numbers c=
ome from? Where would this end?  If you're interested in these ideas=
, we can talk more about it, and I have some reading I can recommend (not a=
ll of which is math reading!) ----------------------This forward=
