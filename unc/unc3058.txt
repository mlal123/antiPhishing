Good morning everyone!

Thank you so much for demoing at the Middle School/High School Open House
this Saturday! We really appreciate your help! The event will run from
1pm-4pm, but we ask that you *please arrive by 12:30pm* to check in, set up
your demo and grab some food. *We will serve lunch starting at 12:15pm in
FB220.*

We will hang signs near each demo, but will also have a floorplan in FB220
when you check in, in case you aren't sure where your demo will be.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you all again for your
help - we couldn't have this great outreach event without you!

Best,
Hope
