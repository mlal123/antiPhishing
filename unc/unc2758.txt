A couple students have mentioned that they couldn't update their GPA using
the directions provided in my previous email. These instructions should get
you to the page where you can update major, minor, GPA, and grad year.

   - From your home page, on the right-hand column under "Getting Started",
   click on "Academic Profile"
   - From that page you can update your majors, minors, grad year, and GPA.
   - You might also consider changing your privacy setting as well. (Found
   under the Privacy tab on top of the My Account page") If you want your
   resume included in resume books requested by employers, be sure the first
   question is answered "yes".



   - Check to see if your default resume is still up to date. If not,
   upload a new one and then delete the old. You won't have to go through the
   approval process again if you do it this way.
