I'll be giving a Tec Talk this Friday at 11:00 am in FB009. The talk
will be in two parts. The first part will cover:
-The types of attacks you face
-Some ways to secure your computer
-What makes a good password and how to make one
-Storing your password safely
-How to tighten security of your browser

The second part will be oriented more towards Staff and Graduate student
and will cover some of the UNC CH policies on sensitive data and how to
recognize and protect it.

If you would like to attend this talk, please go to the doodle poll here

and enter your first and last name. This way we'll have an idea of how
many people will attend.
