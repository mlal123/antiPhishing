Good evening, all,  I'm heading out of state for a conference for the rest of the week, which means I won't be able to hold my regular office hour tomorrow (Thursday, Nov. 9). I am happy to answer questions about your upcoming concert report via e-mail, but be advised that it might take me longer than usual to reply to your messages. I'll resume my usual office hours next Thursday, Nov. 16, 12:30-1:30 PM.  Sorry for the inconvenience! Enjoy the rest of the week,  Samantha
