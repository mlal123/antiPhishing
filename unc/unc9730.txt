** Mixed Methods Research: Foundations for Design=2C Execution and Dissemi=
nation
------------------------------------------------------------


** Scholar: Cheryl Poth
------------------------------------------------------------

The overall goal of this workshop is to engage in discussions of perceived=
 (and real) challenges when designing=2C conducting=2C and disseminating m=
ixed methods research.

To achieve this goal=2C we will consider three key questions:
1. What distinguishes quality mixed methods research designs from other ty=
pes of research?
2. How can researchers avoid common pitfalls seen in mixed methods researc=
h designs and articles?
3. What recent advances in the field of mixed methods research can be inco=
rporated into designs and manuscripts?

Knowledge of and experience with the issues raised in these questions will=
 maximize the quality of your designs=2C feasibility of your procedures=2C=
 and avenues for disseminating your completed mixed methods research.

Dates: Monday - Tuesday=2C July 23 - 24
