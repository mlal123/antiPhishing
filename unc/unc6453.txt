From: Ray Wang (raywang) - raywang@live.unc.eduHi All,  Your SWOT and Customer Empathy Maps are due at 11:59 PM on 9/28, although your groups should have a preliminary version of both of these ready by the coaching session earlier that day. You should follow the templates as posted under Resources, and submit through the Assignment tab, with one submission per group (designate someone in your group to submit).  Best,  Ray ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "ECON125.001.FA17" site.
