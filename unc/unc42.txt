The eduroam network uses digital certificates to authenticate you to the network as well as allow your device to verify that it is connecting to an official UNC wireless access point before allowing sensitive data to pass through.  Your device installed these certificates as part of the installation process. 

!THESE DIGITAL CERTIFICATES WILL EXPIRE ONE YEAR AFTER THE INSTALLATION DATE!

We will send you a friendly reminder 10 days prior to certificate expiration.  At that time, please connect to the UNC-Setup wireless network that is located on campus and reconfigure your device to extend connectivity for an additional year.  Failure to complete this task by the expiration date will result in a loss of network connectivity until the process is completed.  If you have any questions, please contact the ITRC Helpdesk at (919) 962-HELP.
