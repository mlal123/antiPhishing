The BIOL 101.002 Final Exam will be on Tuesday, May 9 from 12:00pm to 2:30p=
m in G100 (our usual classroom). Please bring a pencil and a scantron. No c=
alculators will be allowed.   **If you have three exams in 24hours please s=
ee my previous announcement. The make up exam will be Friday 5/5 at 8am**  =
Some details about the exam: it will be all multiple choice. You will have =
70 questions to answer. The exam is cumulative, which means it will cover a=
ll of the material/concepts/objectives since the beginning of the semester.=
 However, roughly half of the questions will pertain to material from Unit =
4, on which you have not yet been tested.  How to Study for the Final Exam:=
  1.=A0Work your weaknesses:=A0conduct an=A0Exam Item Analysis (see our Res=
ources folders) on exams 1, 2, 3 and identify what material you have not ye=
t mastered. This is the material you should plan to review most heavily. =
=A0Use the lesson objectives and your course outlines to get organized and =
track your progress. Be sure to review problems from the Mastering Biology =
assignments=A0and your readings.  2.=A0Keep track of your study time: Resis=
t the urge to only study the latest material. Keep track of how much time y=
ou spend studying. Make sure that your study strategies mimic what you will=
 do in an exam (analyze, compare, explain).=A0  3.=A0Plan your study time c=
arefully.=A0=A0Be as explicit in how you will spend your study time as poss=
ible. For example, rather than say "On Monday, I'll study biology for 2 hou=
rs." Say, "On Monday, I will go over Lecture 22 and make sure I can explain=
 objectives 2-5. I plan to spend 2 hours on this task."=A0As much as possib=
le: do not cram the night before. Start studying today!  4.=A0Avoid electro=
nic distractions (especially when studying from SimUText).=A0We convince ou=
rselves every day that we can successfully multitask. This is false. Our br=
ains cannot do multiple tasks at once. Instead, the brain switches between =
tasks, losing valuable information every time you ask it to switch focus. W=
hen you are studying,=A0turn off notifications on your phone and computer, =
and if necessary=A0install extensions that prevent you from visiting distra=
cting sites=A0(I used something similar when writing my dissertation!).=A0 =
 As always, use the=A0PMs, SIs and Piazza. Work together, but be mindful th=
at shared Google docs are dangerous! Because=A0"going over" what other peop=
le have written will not be as helpful as writing out your own ideas and ho=
lding discussions when you get stuck.=A0  Calculating Grades:  I do not use=
 the Sakai grade=A0book to calculate your grades;=A0it merely serves as a v=
enue for me to report scores. All of your scores for the semester will be e=
ntered by Weds, May 3=A0(please note that Sakai does not automatically drop=
 your lowest midterm exam score, but I will!). The syllabus also has a clea=
r table for converting your total average grade in the course into a letter=
 grade.  Final grades will be calculated as the syllabus states: The=A0lowe=
st midterm exam grade is dropped, I also adjust=A0the participation score t=
o account for absences/tech issues. Therefore, your total score for the sem=
ester is=3D (0.25 x exam) + (0.25 x exam) + (0.25 x final exam) + (0.18 mas=
tering biology assignments and quizzes average) + (0.07 in-class participat=
ion score -- this includes GRQs you turned in, two group activities, and Le=
arning Catalytics points)  Warm wishes,  Dr. Evans  =A0
