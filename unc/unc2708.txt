Hi all -

Due to an adjusted timeline for this pay cycle with Payroll, all TIM
approvals and signoffs must be completed today. * Everyone needs to approve
their time card for the pay period that ended yesterday 9/18 by noon today,
9/19.*

Since we have some new folks using TIM, here is a step-by-step instruction -

   - Log into TIM
   - Go up to the top and click on "My Information" and "My Timecard".
   - Look to see what pay period you are in - see the first screenshot
   below.  *Please make sure you are in the previous pay period.*  If you
   are not, click on the drop down next to "Time Period" and change it to
   "Previous Pay Period".
   - [image: Inline image 1]
   - Review your time card and make sure everything looks correct.
   - Click on "Approvals" and then "Approve".

Please let me know if you have any questions, and *please approve your time
card for the previous pay period by noon today!*

Thanks,
