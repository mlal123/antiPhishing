Hey Dr. Bishop I would just like to apologize for any trouble I may cause
you by passing my weekly work hour limit. I finally had some more free time
in the past month and wanted to get some more work done. I had totally
forgot that I had a 20hour/week limit. So again I just wanted to apologize
for any inconvenience from the school I may have caused you because of this.
