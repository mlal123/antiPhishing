*Organization:* Genomics/Bioinformatics Lab

The Phanstiel Lab (http://www.unc.edu/~dphansti/) at UNC is looking for an
undergraduate researcher to assist in a software development project in a
genomics/bioinformatics lab. We are an interdisciplinary lab that uses
cutting edge techniques including CRISPR/Cas9, genomics, and bioinformatics
to understand the inner workings of the human genome. The student will work
with the PI on a software development project for the analysis,
integration, and visualization of genomic data sets. This is a great
opportunity for computer science majors who are interested in getting
exposure to genomics and bioinformatics or for biology major with an
interest in software development.

The student should have a good attention to detail, some computer science
training, and know how to write code in at least one language.  Experience
with the programming language R is preferred but not required. Must be able
to commit to 9-12 hours per week. Interested students should contact Prof
Phanstiel directly at douglas_phanstiel@med.unc.edu with CV, cover letter
with a brief description of why they are interested, and their availability
for the Spring semester.

*Position Type: *course credit or volunteer
