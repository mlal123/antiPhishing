The LInCS Networking Reception  offers
our students the opportunity to connect directly with employers in a
variety of fields. Representatives will be stationed around the Sitterson
Hall lobby to answer questions and talk to students about full-time and
internship opportunities within their company. Employer profiles will be
available closer to the date of the event to help you get the most out of
the opportunity. Registration is required for students, and business cards
and resumes are encouraged!
