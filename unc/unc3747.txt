Hi all -

Just a reminder that the last day you can work this semester as a work
study student is *Friday, December 16th*.  This is assuming you have not
exceeded your allotment - no one is in immediate danger of this, but
remember you can check your TRL google spreadsheet if you want an update on
how many hours you have remaining in your award.

Please let me know if you have any questions, and have a great break!
