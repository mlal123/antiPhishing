I've had a number of questions from students about the Computational
Photography special topics course, so here's some more information.  Note
that the COMP 572 syllabus shows linear algebra as a prerequisite though it
does not apply to COMP 590.  If you have questions about whether you will
be okay in the course, please contact Prof Berg (aberg@cs.unc.edu).

There will be an offering of Computational Photography in Spring 2016 MW
2:30-3:45.  In future years, this will be COMP 572,  but is offered as 590
topics course in Spring 2016.  (If you need an exception to count an extra
590 course, we can help.)   You can find last year's course website as a
reference here: http://acberg.com/comp_photog/   and the syllabus is
attached.  It is a fun course exploring computational approaches for
measuring and re-rendering light.
