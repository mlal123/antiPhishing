Hey Racquetballers,

A few things I wanted to cover and please read everything!

(1) Forms: There are two forms that each person attending the Liberty Tourn=
ament must fill out before we go to the tournament (this was a last minute =
request from Phil/Bonny).  One is the waiver and the other is the USAR Memb=
ership.  You must be a USAR member to compete in the MACRC (our college tou=
rnament).  So if you missed Monday night's practice, be there tonight, find=
 me, and fill out the forms. It was pointed out to me that some of you may =
still have current memberships depending when you joined the club last year=
 - you can log onto the USAR website and see if your membership is current =
and take this up with Phil/Bonny.

(2) USAR Membership Form: It is required to be a USAR member to compete in =
the MACRC and the cost is $25 for you if you are 24 and under. If you are o=
ld like me (25 and up) it is $50.  This not only lets you compete in what w=
e do at the college level but in other tournaments as well. Remember that s=
tate tournament Greg and I went to a few weeks ago?  It lets you be a membe=
r and able to register for all sorts of racquetball tournaments all over th=
e US (listed on the USAR website).  So this is a REMINDER TO BRING CASH.  T=
his will need to be paid at the tournament directly to Phil and Bonny for y=
ou to play. This is not something that goes towards the club and is not pai=
d to Greg and I.

(3) We are staying at the Econo Lodge for the tournament.  Please do not br=
oadcast that we are staying 6 people to a 4 person room, as the hotel will =
probably not be a fan and we cannot afford more rooms.  If you have an air =
mattress let me know (shoot me an email), otherwise, if you have a nice com=
fy sleeping bag I would highly recommend bringing it along with an extra pi=
llow.  We have 4 rooms right beside each other and the reservations (for th=
ose of you that will get there before me) are all under my name.  I will st=
op by when I get into town (7:30-8 ish) and check us all in since most of y=
ou will be driving directly to the courts.
Address for the Hotel:
Econo Lodge
2400 Stadium Rd.
Lynchburg, VA, US, 24501
+1 (434) 847-1045
Address for the Courts:
The Sports Racket
118 Davis Cup Rd.
Lynchburg, VA, US, 24502
+1 (434) 385-7534

(4) As far as "extracurricular activities" are concerned while at the tourn=
ament: I want to remind everyone that they represent UNC 24-7 (not just whi=
le on the courts). So make good adult decisions and remember that the conse=
quences of not making good adult decisions do not just fall on you, but on =
the club itself.  I ask that if you do decide to partake in whatever activi=
ties may arise that you do not wear "UNC Club Racquetball" or "UNC" in gene=
ral clothing, etc.  Remember that Liberty is a very conservative school, so=
 the community surrounding us will not hesitate to report any activity they=
 deem unfit. Therefore, I expect responsible adult behavior from everyone.

(5) While at the tournament....
I would like to ask everyone to be patient. Most of you know Phil and Bonny=
 from last year, they are excellent people. They have had a little bit of a=
 health scare lately (and none of us are getting any younger) so I know the=
y have been working overtime organizing and handling all the tournament det=
ails. We've had a few hiccups with our submissions (nothing serious) but no=
ne the less - we all know it is easy to mix things up if you are in a hurry=
 - so relax and be polite. If you are asked to help perform a task (or see =
a task that needs to be done) while at the tournament (refilling water jugs=
, laying out food, carrying something for Bonny), please do so.  We have re=
ceived many compliments in the past about how helpful our team is, which is=
 great, but sometimes the other teams will take advantage of this. If you f=
eel that you are being asked to help out a little too much, just let me kno=
w and I will take care of it.  Traditionally the hosting team (Liberty) is =
suppose to run the board and take care of the tasks, but since they are run=
ning two tournaments this year we can certainly make ourselves useful.

(6) Lastly (non-tournament related) there is a leadership series on Sports =
Nutrition (speaker details are shown below). Greg and I are attending becau=
se it gives our club points - but it is open to anyone and everyone. If you=
 are interested in attending shoot me an email by Friday afternoon and I'll=
 add you to the list.  I wanted to offer this up to anyone interested.
Leadership Series Speaker: Kelsee Gomes, UNC Director of Sports Nutrition: =
The Sport Clubs program conducts a Leadership Series of presentations where=
 we focus on individual growth with learning and development outcomes focus=
ed around dynamic learning, honor, personal responsibility and community en=
gagement as a requirement for our Sport Club Officers. Attendance at these =
workshops earns teams compliance points and are typically reserved for just=
 officers. The next Leadership Series presentation will be Kelsee Gomes, UN=
C Director of Nutrition on Tuesday October 13th at 6:00pm and this will be =
available for ALL Sport Club members to attend. Kelsee works closely with U=
NC=92s varsity athletic teams, providing sports nutrition education, nutrit=
ion counseling, and meal planning assistance.

Sorry so long, if you have any questions feel free to ask! Otherwise, see y=
ou on the courts tonight! If you play a game tomorrow and you have already =
filled out the waiver/USAR form, feel free to take it easy tonight or take =
the night off so you don't get worn out.  Otherwise be there! :-)
