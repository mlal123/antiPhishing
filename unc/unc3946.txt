Hey disc golfers,
Hope everyone had a good break!  As a heads up baskets are not back on the =
course yet so if you want to play at UNC there is only a pole to hit (good =
for putting).  We are waiting on the paint shop the finish them up and send=
 them back to us.  When that happens I will be sending out an email looking=
 for people to help put everything back together.  But while we wait for th=
at I have a few announcements.

  *   We are looking to field a team to go to NC state January  21-22,  pla=
ying at buckhorn and jones park.  email me if you can play that tournament.

  *   PDGA membership:  if you are not PDGA member yet and are a member of =
the club we have 20% discounts of those who are interested.



Stay warm and good luck on the first day of classes.
