Ask Marquis! Med School Q&A


Q: I just want to know, after going through medical school, do you wish you=
 had taken time off, do you have any regrets, is the timeless study hours a=
nd huge debt worth it?

This is an interesting question that I think would be better to answer in p=
erson, but I=92ll give it a shot here. I do not wish I had taken time off b=
etween medical school and I do not regret pursuing medicine. However, if I =
could redo my decision with all the knowledge I have now, I wouldn=92t do i=
t over.



I love Psychiatry and I am glad I found it, but there other career options =
that would have as much of a financial and/or social impact that I could ha=
ve chosen. My loan burden for medical school is about $70K, the national av=
erage is 180K (though 80% of medical student are from families where income=
 is in the top 80% of the country. Some people=92s parent pay off their deb=
t, so the real average is probably much higher.) If I did it over, I=92d be=
 a chef, in the State Department, entrepreneurship, or some form of writing=
. Though the nice thing about my future salary will be that I can make a gr=
eat salary part-time, while pursuing my other interests as well. And I can =
combine many of these passions. I just won=92t be able to do as much as I w=
ant until after Residency (4 years for Psych).


Also in terms of the hours thing, it is a huge sacrifice. You are basically=
 sacrificing your 20s. You=92re studying all during undergrad, REALLY study=
ing during medical school with hospital rotations that often exceed 70 hour=
s/week, and when you are in residency (3-12 years depending on specialty) y=
ou=92re constantly working 70+ hours/week for 52-60k a year. It is a long j=
ourney.



Whether it is worth it depends on the individual. If you think you=92d be j=
ust as happy doing something else, then I=92d strongly consider doing that =
something else. But if there=92s nothing else you think you would want to d=
o, then go for it. Unfortunately, you can=92t know whether it=92s worth it =
until after you=92ve been through it.
