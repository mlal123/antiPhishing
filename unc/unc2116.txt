Tomorrow is the last day of the $500 tuition reduction* on the

Essentials business training program.

UNC Business Essentials was developed by UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School

faculty to strengthen the business knowledge of anyone who has a
non–business
background or major. Its flexible, 100% online format allows individuals to
choose
their start dates and work at their own pace, and the program content is
delivered in
multiple formats in order to improve knowledge retention.  

Each of the six modules takes approximately 10-12 hours to finish so that
the entire
program can be completed four months if you spend 4-5 hours on it a
week. 

Please give me a call or email me if you'd like to discuss UNC Business
Essentials.  
Enroll now to take advantage of the $500 tuition reduction. (
