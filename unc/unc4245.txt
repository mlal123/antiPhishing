Good Morning!

Google will be in Sitterson Hall on Monday performing mock interviews. Any
student can use the link below to request a spot. Please note that these
interview schedules are handled by Google so even if you have already
signed up for a mock interview later that week, you can still do a mock
interview with Google. Here is the link to express interest. Spaces are
limited: goo.gl/F4gwlv
