Updated instructions and forms are now available on the department
website.  If you have any trouble with the forms, please let me know.  I
was using a new set of tools and while I think that I fixed the quirks, I
may not have caught them all.  Also, please feel free to send me questions
or drafts for me to review.  You need to come to my office with the final
version, but I'm happy to help with drafts.  Deadline is January 12 (Friday
after classes start).

Enjoy the rest of your break!
