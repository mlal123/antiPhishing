Hey,  For some reason I messed up the right hand rule in class today (I con=
fused it with something else in physics), so I apologize for that and I'll =
show it to you again on Tuesday. In the meantime, to put into words how to =
do it, there are two ways (you can also check the book):  1. You point the =
four fingers into the +x direction. Then you fold them (close the hand) int=
o the direction of the +y axis (the shorter way, i.e. cover the 90 degree a=
ngle, not the other way around doing 270 degrees). The thumb then gives you=
 the +z direction. (So instead of what I said in class, i.e. four fingers i=
n the +x direction, thumb in the +y direction, fold gives you the +z direct=
ion, it's four fingers in the +x direction, fold towards the +y direction, =
thumb in the +z direction.)  2. You point the index finger in the +x direct=
ion and bend the middle finger 90 degrees so that it's pointing in the +y d=
irection. Then the thumb gives you the +z direction. (So your hand looks li=
ke a gun with the middle finger bent 90 degrees).  Again, I apologize for t=
his and I'll show you both ways mentioned above on Tuesday.
