Hello Mangza,

I have received your Remedy ticket. I currently see two "Cancelled" requests under your ID in ConnectCarolina. One is for the 2017 Spring term, and the other is for the 2017 Fall term. Since both requests currently have a status of "Cancelled", the system will not allow you to submit another request for the same term until the original "Cancelled" request has been deleted. If you can please confirm the term in which you are attempting to apply, I will go ahead and removed the "Cancelled" request for that term in ConnecCarolina. This will allow you to submit your new request without any issues.

Thank you,
