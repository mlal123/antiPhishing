Folks -- I'll see you soon in class for the midterm. Please note that we
will have NO office hours today and tomorrow.  We want to concentrate on
grading your midterms and giving you feedback as soon as possible. Hence no
office hours today and tomorrow.

Of course, you are still welcome to send your queries to Piazza and the
team email. Thanks.
