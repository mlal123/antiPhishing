I receive many notes and calls from students who credit the online UNC
Business Essentials (UBE) program
with improving their employment opportunities.

“The UNC Business Essentials program was a great way for a non-business
major like me, who had very
little professional experience, to build a solid knowledge base of
important business related topics, such as
operations, supply chains, marketing, and communications at a very
reasonable pace. The program proved
extremely valuable to me this past year as I interviewed for jobs
post-graduation.”

            -Andrew, 2015 UNC Business Essentials graduate

Andrew graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a BS in psychology this past May
and was hired as a business
consultant by a Fortune 500 software company in DC. He attributes his
understanding of fundamental
business concepts to UNC Business Essentials:

“For me, the most beneficial aspect of the course was the introduction
and drilling of important business-
related vocabulary that often came up in interviews or other professional
conversations that I had not been
exposed to at that point, which really helped me keep up with the
conversation and respond intelligently
and effectively.”

UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School designed the non-degree UNC Business
Essentials program to provide
non-business majors with a solid understanding of the business
fundamentals, and it is available to anyone
who wants to learn basic business principles. Its flexible online format
allows students to learn on their own
personal schedules without interrupting their day-to-day activities. Upon
completion of the program,
graduates gain a business certificate from UNC Kenan-Flagler Business
School which helps them stand out
as they navigate the increasingly competitive job market.
