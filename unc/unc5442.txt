Hey Mangza,
I see you're planning to check out around 10PM tomorrow. That should be =
all good, I'll come meet you at your room then. If you happen to finish ear=
ly that's fine too but I have something before and probably won't be back i=
n Carmichael until around 9:30.
Let me know if anything changes.
Thanks,
Bryan
