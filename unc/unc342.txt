Thanks for asking—they do indeed count! That said, if you need t=
o go slightly over 800 words after you’ve added these contextualizing=
 phrases, that is just fine.

Hello professor Landers! I have one more thing to ask, may seem sil=
ly but, when we cite things with words (i.e "According to this researc=
h done by Columbia university..." ) do those count towards our 800 wor=
d count and such?

Hi Mangza,


As long as your hyperlinks take me to the article itself, you should b=
e good to go. Do also make sure to include a basic citation for each source=
 at the bottom of your blog post as we discussed in class.
