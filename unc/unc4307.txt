Dear Carmichael Residents,

As you all know, the University is closed right now due to water shortage. =
As such, please ensure that you are using as little water as possible, up t=
o and including flushing as little as possible in your restrooms and avoidi=
ng showering. I've been told that port-a-lets are being ordered and as soon=
 as more information is given to me about that I will ensure it is given to=
 you.

Lenoir Dining Hall is closed at this time, but Ram's Head remains open, as =
is Ram's Head market.

If you intend to cook in the hall, please be extra cautious and stay with y=
our food at all times. The water level is so low there are concerns that sp=
rinklers may not function as well as normal, so any fire at this time is es=
pecially dangerous. If there is a fire or an alarm goes off, please call 91=
1 to report it immediately to ensure the most rapid response possible.

I have no information about when we can expect this shortage to end, but I =
would prepare as though this will last through the weekend. Anyone who is a=
ble to go home should consider themselves encouraged to do so.

Your Resident Assistants and I will be here, so please reach out to us if y=
ou need anything or have any questions about the situation. We're here to  =
assist in any way we can.

Sincerely,
