I know... two emails in one day is a bit much. But in my defense, it's the
busy season and you don't want to miss out. Speaking of missing out, note
that Epic Health will be here with CHIPOTLE on Wednesday at 5:30pm in
Sitterson 011. Not many have RSVP'd yet and I need to get their food order
in. If you plan to attend AND eat please RSVP* before Monday morning *when
the food order will be placed. Here is the link:
