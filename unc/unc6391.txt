Hi all -

If you are getting this email, you are a work study student for Computer
Science who has not turned in a TIM training certificate.  Please go to
https://apps.fa.unc.edu/finance/training/tim-students-temps/ and follow the
tutorial.  When you are done (it's only 15 minutes) please print the
certificate, write your name in and then sign and date it and bring to me.
Electronic or hard copy is fine, as long as it has your legibly written
name, signature, and a date.  *Even if you have
used TIM before,please complete the tutorial and send or bring me your
training certificate.*

Thanks,

Beth
