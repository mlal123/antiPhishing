Hello new tarheels!

I hope you're enjoying the last few days of summer. My name is Shelly and I'm your new covenant mentor for the upcoming fall. I'm a sophomore majoring in computer science and I cannot wait to meet all of you! Please reply with a time you'd like to meet, either individually or as a group.
