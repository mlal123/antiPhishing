The program's six online modules were designed by UNC Kenan-Flagler
Business
School to teach key business principles and can be taken anytime, anywhere,
by
anyone - you do not have to be a UNC student to take this program and to
get this
reduced tuition. Learn the business fundamentals with UNC Business
Essentials and
approach your next interview or performance review with confidence.

I'd be happy to discuss the program and reduced tuition offer with you and
answer
any questions you may have. If you've already enrolled and taken advantage
of this
tuition offer, congratulations on taking the next step towards your future
success.

Sincerely,
