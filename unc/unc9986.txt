Hello Mangza,

The purpose of this email is to let you know=
 that we have decided not to open up the room refinement period that was se=
t to run from July 2nd to July 31st. While we recognize that many=
 students were looking forward to this as an opportunity to change the=
ir housing assignment, there are very few spaces available to choose from. =
With so few spaces available, we did not want to create a situation wh=
ere students are constantly logging in to look for rooms, only to find ther=
e is nothing available. 

Carolina Housing will continue to offer room=
 reassignments through the room reassignment request process. If you wish t=
o submit a reassignment request or would like more information about r=
oom reassignments, please visit https://housing.unc.=
edu/residents/current-residents/housing-reassignment-request.
