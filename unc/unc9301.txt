Looking for a way to diversify your resume and stand out to future employer=
s? The UNC Business Essentials (UBE) program is designed to help you develo=
p a sound foundation in business knowledge in areas like accounting, market=
ing, and operations, no matter what your major or area of expertise. The on=
line format makes it flexible to fit busy schedules, and you'll earn a valu=
able credential from Kenan-Flagler Business School.

Take it from Ally, who learned the value of the knowledge gained through UB=
E while studying abroad in Singapore.

I witnessed how the material I was learning through Kenan-Flagler was impac=
ted by cultures and customs, and used my international experience to really=
 understand the value in developing these business skills. So while busines=
s may differ in some ways across the world, having an understanding of busi=
ness principles will be an asset no matter where you are.

Claire, a journalism major at UNC, realized her full potential through UBE =
and an internship.

I found myself more and more engaged with the business side of things at th=
e Charlotte Agenda because of the modules I'd been learning for UBE. At hap=
py hour, I chimed in on business strategies, marketing techniques, and othe=
r ways to move the company forward. I asked questions about how the company=
 got started, how they maintain their social media presence, and what strat=
egies they use for partnerships.
