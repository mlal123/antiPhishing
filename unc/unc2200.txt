From: Logan Tatham (ltatham) - ltatham@live.unc.eduHello class,=
  I have seriously had so much fun writing the exam for Wednesday. I kno=
w exams can be stressful, but I think I really have a fun set of problems f=
or you all to do!  First, I am writing this just to make sure everyo=
ne knows the exam is on Wednesday. It will cover Sections 6.1-6.3, 7.1-7.5,=
 and 7.8 (we are covering 7.5 and 7.8 on Monday and Tuesday; 7.5 serves as =
a good chance to review and tie things together, so we'll integrate (p=
un intended) that section into our review time).  Some things to kno=
w for the exam, besides the sections covered include:    The un=
it circle and trigonometric identities (including the half-angle formulas f=
or sin^2(x),cos^2(x))  Algebra (especially factoring, expanding, r=
ules of logarithms)  Material from calculus 1, especially u-substi=
tution and basic derivatives/integrals  (a table of these are on the re=
ference pages in the back of your book. I expect you to know Differentiatio=
n Rules 1-24 on Reference Page 5 and items 1-18 of the table of integrals (=
maybe just letting a=3D1 in 16, 17, and 18))   We will have so=
me time to review before the exam in class, but be sure to study on your ow=
n, as well.  Logan ----------------------This forwarded m=
