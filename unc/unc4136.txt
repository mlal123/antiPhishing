Dear Carmichael Residents,

I am writing you today to ask that you review the below information about C=
armichael Composting. It seems that we regularly have items that are not su=
pposed to be mixed in and that causes our compost materials to have to be t=
hrown out. Sadly, it seems this is a regular occurrence.

Please review this information about what can and cannot be composted to en=
sure that our sustainability efforts are successful:

-What CANNOT be composted:

  *   No synthetic materials: metals, plastics, etc.
-What CAN be composted:

  *   Paper products: pizza boxes, paper plates, shredded paper, paper boxe=
s from Lenoir (preferably no bulk paper)
  *   Fruit, vegetables, hair, nails, coffee grounds, tea bags
Carmichael's compost bin is located next to the recycling bins on the North=
 side of Carmichael. Please DO NOT put non-compostable materials in the com=
post bin, or else the entire bin is contaminated.

I attached a flyer that goes into more detail for your reference.

Thanks you!
