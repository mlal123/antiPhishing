Good morning!

I hope everyone is feeling great at the end of the semester and beginning
of summer break!

I wanted to send this message as it's come to my attention that a
fellowship I advertised that seemed to be free for students, is in
actuality, not free (in most cases). If you have applied to the Horizon's
Fellowship and they "awarded" you a partial scholarship, you may want to
think twice about what you will get out of the program vs. the money it
will cost you to attend. It seems to me, that as CS majors at UNC, you will
not be gaining a lot out of this program for the money it will cost.

My goal is to never advertise something that charges our students.
Sometimes these things get through and that is not my intent. Moving
forward,* if you apply to something that asks for money, please take the
time to talk to me, someone at Career Services, or a professor *about the
program and do your research online about the organization before making
any commitment or paying any money. If this opportunity was advertised
through any person or office on campus, please let them know so that they
can remove the listing and warn student if necessary.

I am not familiar with the intricacies of this program and can't say that
it wouldn't be helpful for some students, however, being that it will cost
thousands of dollars in many cases, I would not recommend it for our CS
students.

If you have questions, please let me know.
