Hi Mangza,
The end of semester has been a little bit crazy for me to wrap my head around potential projects…and to make matters worse I’m not available to meet in the mornings.
 What days are you free after 12:30?

I can meet in the morning before 9:30 everyday, (although I have lab on Tuesdays at 9:30 and after 3:30pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays).
 And I can meet anytime after our Bio class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

Hey Dr. Evans, I'm emailing you about our talk today and seeing when you would like to meet. I can meet tomorrow after 3:30 if you'd  like or anytime before or after class on Friday until 3:00pm.
 We can also meet next week if that'd work best.
