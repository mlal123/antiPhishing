From: Buck Goldstein (goldstb) - buck_goldstein@unc.eduHello to All=
  I just finished reading Assignment 6 and I wanted to pass along so=
me comments that should guide you as you complete the remaining deliverable=
s.  There is a huge difference in the level of effort from student t=
o student.  Some of you put in enough time and thought to develop an i=
nteresting point of view on the question.  In some cases you far excee=
d my expectations.  Others of you "mail it in" putting in ju=
st enough effort to check the box but with nothing particularly notable.&nb=
sp; For instance, many of you did not even mention Drucker's seven sources =
of innovation anywhere in assignment 6.  I was disappointed by that. I=
 know your work is engaging and Jen is very pleased with the group and how =
you have come together.  However, let's not get into a senior slump to=
ward the end of the semester.  Your final grade for this class will be=
 based on your entire body of work with major emphasis on the final project=
 presentation but these weekly blogs count and the work and thought you put=
 into them can be incorporated into your final project presentation.  =
The bottom line is I put in the time to read your blogs and I want you to p=
roduce something worth reading.  I did not send specific comments on=
 your blog to each of you but rest assured I read them all.  I have no=
t read Blog 7.  Anyone who wants to redo Blog 7 in light of these comm=
ents should feel free to do so.  --Buck ---------------------=
