Good morning everyone,

We hope that you had a fantastic semester abroad! As a scholarship recipient, we ask that you take a moment to communicate how the award impacted your experience. We have created a new questionnaire on your {https://heelsabroad.unc.edu/ heelsabroad account} entitled "Scholarship Follow-Up" and ask that you take some time to answer the three questions provided. This information will then be shared with the donor of your scholarship so they can understand the impact that their gift has on the lives and experiences of our students.

Please log in and complete the questionnaire by August 1, 2018.

Regards,
