Hey Y’all, 
 
Quick question and ask. Who is here during Spring Break and if you are, would you be willing to spend a little time a part of a student panel for our new CD Candidates coming to campus. I am not assure of all the details but you would chat
 with the new candidate for about an hour about your experience as an RA and also get to ask the candidate a couple questions and then be able to have your input in the hiring process. More details are with Mo and Patrick right now and I would be forwarding
 your name over to them and they would be the best to get all the details on the panel if you are able to do it. No pressure or anything, but if you want your voice heard on who we bring in as one of our CDs, this is a chance to be a part of that process. Please
 let me know ASAP. Thanks.
