Hello everyone!


Today I was lucky enough to meet some of you wonderful people and it made m=
e that much more excited to meet ALL of you on Sunday!!!


A few notes about Sunday (the 16th).... We will be having a mandatory floor=
 meeting (get hype!) and our time slot is 4:40 in the 7th floor lounge! We =
will be getting to know one another a little bit and learn some more about =
Hojo and expectations for the year. We will be leaving shortly after that f=
or Convocation so I recommend wearing Carolina blue!! After Convocation we =
will all head over to Fall fest for lots of free food and to *~get involved=
~* and learn about all of the amazing organizations UNC has to offer!


Lastly, for those of you have haven't moved in yet, here is the DL:


1. Check-In is in the Orange Room (look for the signs) to get your key/flex=
 pass for the building before you start moving your things into your room! =
The whole don't bring things in first is vital because the lobby WILL get c=
logged up if you do and nobody wants that.


2. Empty out your car because the quicker you can move it to Ram's Head Par=
king Deck the better the parking lot is for everyone else trying to move in=
! Technically, you have a 40 minute parking limit, but remember there are a=
 lot of you trying to all move-in at the same time so be respectful pretty =
please!


3. VERY IMPORTANT! The RA's will be operating on manual (meaning you are no=
t in control). It helps to streamline the process, but for it to work well =
we ask that you take the stairs back down to the main level.


I am stoked to meet you all on Sunday at 4:40 if not before then!! Travel s=
afely!


Love,

Mary Scott
