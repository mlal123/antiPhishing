That boy up to something he just not just bluffing!


(I am going to preface this email by saying there are a lot of Drake refere=
nces lol)
What=92s up my peoples?!?!?!?!?! Okay I had to switch the flow up on you, i=
t was getting too predictable! So with that being said, I hope this Aubrey =
=93Drake=94 Graham inspired email finds you all well and y=92all are gettin=
g ready to grind through this last month of the semester!

I know at this point a lot of y=92all are tired of class and days seem to s=
lowly drag by as you count down the days until Thanksgiving break. The days=
 of dressing up nice and being presentable are long gone and thus have turn=
ed into sweatpants, haired tied, chilling with no makeup on. Even I have be=
en on my WORST=85=85.... behavior; paying attention in class has become mor=
e unbearable with every single day. There have even been a few instances wh=
ere ya boy had to skip class but you know what, my excuse is that I=92m you=
ng. In all honesty, I never thought that I=92d be talking from this perspec=
tive but it=92s getting to the point where I stopped giving a hoot and stop=
ped fearing the consequence. I mean I have to enjoy this last little bit of=
 my Carolina career and live it to the fullest; It=92s my senior year and y=
ou know I=92m only here for a good time not a long time. After all I am mov=
ing. =93Where you moving?=94 you may ask and I say =93onto better things=94=
.  #seniorstatus

Let me stop lol! You have to admit though; I=92m on a roll like Cottonelle!=
 In all seriousness though I want let y=92all know that although it may be =
a struggle this far into the semester, the finish line is in sight! Final p=
apers, midterms, projects, presentations, among other things are going to b=
e due in the coming month, you will be able succeed. Don=92t ever discredit=
 or discount your ability; know yourself, know your worth. Make sure to con=
tinue going to professors office hours, go to peer tutoring sessions in Dey=
 hall, or go to the Learning and Writing Centers. This last month is super =
important so make sure to give it your all.

Also, I know that registration is coming up in the next week and I just wan=
ted to remind each of y=92all to go ahead and start planning and filling up=
 your shopping carts. If you need any help doing so please call me on my ce=
llphone and I can give you some advice/tips, etc.
Your New Student Guide will help out a lot as well. Plus, academic advisors=
 in Hardin Hub and Steele Building come in super clutch this time of the ye=
ar and do an excellent job of getting folks on the right track. Last, but c=
ertainly not least, take a deep breath, relax, and try not to stress out. R=
egistration can have you like this=85..

You may not get that perfect schedule like you wanted to but it will all wo=
rk out in the end, trust me!

Halloween is also coming up so please be safe my friends! It can go 0 to 10=
0 real quick especially on Franklin Street. All joking aside, I want y=92al=
l to be safe because Halloween here can get out of control and I want y=92a=
ll to make good choices. Make sure to always have a buddy with you if you c=
hoose to go out, know your limits if youlegally make the choice to drink, s=
tay alert, review UNC =91s Halloween policies, and ALWAYS call emergency se=
rvices if you or anyone else is in need of assistance. You can review you U=
NC=92s policies here:
https://studentaffairs.unc.edu/news-events/news/homegrown-halloween-2015

And I will be attending one last THB event this semester if you would like =
to catch up (see what I did there) with me. It will be the PASS Exam Fair o=
n December 3rd at 6pm in the Union Great Hall. There will be a lot of prize=
s, games, stress relieving activities, and other things to prepare y=92all =
for finals!

Until next time my friends! And in honor of the new Star Wars movie coming =
out...
