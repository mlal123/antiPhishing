Infusion will be in SItteron 011 tomorrow night at 5:30pm to talk to you
all about Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning.

*In the last couple years, a revolution in Artificial Intelligence has
captured the public imagination. We're entering **the era of Deep Learning,
a terrifyingly powerful and intimidating set of technologies. Using
sophisticated neural **networks, these systems have started to achieve the
remarkable: describe the content of images in English words, **play GO (the
ancient board game from the Far East), at the championship level, and
understand natural language **with the sophistication of a human
interlocutor. The implications are profound =E2=80=93 and alarming. **Like =
all
frightening technology revolutions, however, empowerment comes from
understanding. This talk is **about making Deep Learning understandable
enough to not fear.*
