*Full-Time Position with Roivant Sciences*

*About Digital Innovation*

Are you interested in solving complex problems in the biotech space?
Roivant Sciences has a team of Digital Innovators focused on bringing
technology to bear on these problems, and we are looking to grow our team.
As Digital Innovators we sit in different teams within our organization to
understand both the internal and external challenges they face, and we come
up with technological solutions to those challenges.



To give you an idea of the types of projects we work on here's an example
of a Digital Innovation initiative that has provided significant value to
our organization:

Enzyvant is a Roivant subsidiary that focuses on providing treatments for
rare diseases like Farber disease, a lysosomal storage disorder caused by
deficiency in the ceramidase enzyme. This disorder is difficult to diagnose
properly because 1) it presents similarly to juvenile idiopathic arthritis
and 2) it is so rare that many physicians are unaware of it. This presents
challenges for patients trying to find adequate and effective care as well
as for Enzyvant trying to find patients to recruit for clinical trials that
can help the development of a treatment.



To accelerate patient recruitment Enzyvant turned to medical claims data to
identify Farber disease candidates by searching for potentially
misdiagnosed juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients, but this was an
arduous manual task that only identified 2 potential leads in 4 months.



Enter the Digital Innovator. After identifying this as a critical business
need, our Digital Innovator in Enzyvant first researched the problem and
then came up with a much better method of identifying these patients using
the same underlying data. Using a combination of data science and
programming skills in conjunction with domain knowledge, the Digital
Innovator created a system to find the most likely Farber disease
candidates based on gold standard examples provided by a medical
professional. These candidates were then presented for evaluation to the
medical professional who could confirm or reject the suggestions, and the
system captured this scoring to improve the evaluation algorithm and
ultimately provide better matches in the future.



This new tool was created in a couple of weeks, made the patient finding
process about 30 times faster with almost no manual overhead by the
stakeholders, and can be generalized to other disease spaces.



This is what we bring to the business as Digital Innovators, and we are
looking for more highly competent problem solvers with the technical skills
to implement impactful solutions. If you're up for the challenge then
please submit your resume and a statement noting your interest in becoming
a Digital Innovator here
