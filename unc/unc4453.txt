Hey Everyone,

I really appreci=
ate all of you taking the time to help
 introduce students at Culbreth to Computer Science. This is an important o=
pportunity to help increase diversity in the field, and one that could have=
 a lasting impact.

That said, I did=
 want to send a quick note concerning
 attendance at this week=92s igniteCS session. I understand that things com=
e up last minute, but we ask that you do everything you can to keep your Mo=
nday evenings open. Program dates and times have been available for a while=
 now, and it=92s not fair to the students
 when less than half of our mentors are able to attend, not to mention that=
 it reflects poorly on both our program and UNC.

I know everyone =
is very busy, but there are only three
 sessions left (2/20, 2/27, and 3/6), so please keep these dates in mind wh=
en planning your schedule.


Thanks again for=
 your hard work, and I look forward to
 seeing everyone next Monday.

Best,
Lydia Trogdon
