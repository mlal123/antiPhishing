Welcome to COMP 410 for fall 2016

We will meet for the first class Tuesday (today) at 3:30 in Genome Sciences G110.  This is the massive lecture hall on the ground floor.  Go in the entrance that faces Kenan Stadium, and look left.  

Please sit down in the lower rows so I can see you all without binoculars... the room holds about twice the class size.
