Hi all,

I'm writing to let you know that your Menlo rooming assignments are now pos=
ted in the Google Sheet! As noted on the sheet, if your room assignment is =
listed as only a number (without a building name in front of it), it means =
that you will be staying in the apartments across the street from campus.

In looking at the sheet, you'll notice that some of you will be living with=
 non-UNC students-some Menlo College students, and some Notre Dame students=
. In efforts to protect their privacy, each of you will be receiving an ema=
il from me this afternoon with your non-UNC roommates' names and email addr=
esses in case you'd like to contact them in advance of your arrival.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!
