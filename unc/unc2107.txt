Summer break is here again, and many of you will be off on summer
adventures. This summer, if you work an internship, attend a conference,
present a paper, study abroad, or volunteer, please send us a picture and a
brief description so that we can share on social media the awesome things
our students are doing. We would love to hear from you!

Please email your submissions to er@cs.unc.edu and stay tuned to the
Computer Science Facebook , Twitter
, and (new!) Instagram
 accounts to see what other students
in the department are doing this summer. We also have a collection of
previous years' posts on our department website
.

Thanks!
