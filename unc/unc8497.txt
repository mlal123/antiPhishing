Dear Mangza,
We review the cost of attendance each year to reflect changes in tuition, housing
 costs, etc. Usually, this leads to slight increases in the standard student budget.
For the upcoming 2018-19 academic year, our surveys showed some decreases in
 costs. This lowered the overall student budget and the amount of aid available for some students.
The biggest change is ending automatic funding for health insurance. Most students
 carry existing coverage and do not purchase University insurance.
If you plan to purchase University health insurance and need additional funding,
 complete this request
 once you’ve been billed for coverage. We can adjust your budget once University coverage is confirmed.
Our regular survey of student costs also found students spent less, on average,
 in areas like travel, meals, and books. In updating our estimates, we always try to balance full funding with the need to keep student borrowing low. See our
budgeting and borrowing guide
 for details.
Please
contact us
 if you have questions or concerns. We’re happy to work with you.
