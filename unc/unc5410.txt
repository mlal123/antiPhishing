Greetings!  I hope your week of finals is going well! I wanted to let you k=
now that our gradebook is now up to date. The maximum possible LC points yo=
u could earn was 75. On average, we answered 3-4 LC questions a day, so if =
your total (unadjusted) came up to less than 75 points, I added up to 12 "f=
reebie" points to account for LC tech issues or missing class for any absen=
ces. No one got over 75 points. Your Total Adjusted LC points are now visib=
le. Your ultimate participation score will be a result of adding up all the=
 points you earned for activities in the participation category (see the gr=
adebook and syllabus for details).  I've also taken your Mastering Biology =
Assignments and Quiz score and added it to the gradebook. This score is out=
 of 100.  If you have questions about your score, or believe there is an er=
ror, please let me know via email and put BIOL 101 in the subject line=A0=
=A0(I teach three classes, and I get lots of emails with grading questions!=
). Include as much detail in your email (include your reasoning) to help me=
 identify the fix.  If you have questions about how the grades will be calc=
