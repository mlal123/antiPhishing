On October 10th, A Google Engineer will be in Hanes Hall performing
one-on-one mock coding interviews. They will be here all day but since
these are hour long sessions, there are only 6 available spots. If you are
interested in practicing your technical interviews skills with a Google
engineer, please log into your Careerolina account immediately and search
"Coding Interview Practice with Professionals"
