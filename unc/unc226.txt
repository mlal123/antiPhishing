Dear Student,

I write today to invite you to be a part of the Carolina M.A.L.E.S. (Men Ad=

itiative, which will serve as an overarching and all-inclusive university p=
rogram for undergraduate male students of color.  The program will focus on=
 building community for our current male students of color in order to enco=
urage them to engage in well-established, high-impact programs in which the=
y are typically underrepresented.  The initiative will help you identify re=
sources, enhance their academic experience, and encourage them to take resp=
onsibility for their education and decisions.

You will all be charged to take "control" of your experience and commit to =
values of personal responsibility, group accountability, and contribution t=
