A few of you expressed interest over the Telegram in learning more on So=
lidity/Dapp development, especially with the upcoming hackathon in mind. I'=
ll be at 1789 from 1=
0AM onwards with a demo, code-along starting at 11AM. I'd recommend coming early to giv=
e yourself time to setup/install before you start building your first Dapp.=
 

 

Why is Solidity and the Truffle Framework important? With Solidity, you =
can write smart-contracts containing the business logic of the app you want=
 to develop.This makes it possible to ruffle, "adds another layer of a=
bstraction to the tedious syntax of solidity/web3," or in simpler term=
s, it makes it easy to link your smart contracts to your front-end and mana=
ge deployments. 

 

I'm certainly not an experienced Truffle/Solidity developer myself, and =
will inevitably encounter some hiccups tomorrow, but I'll try my best. If y=
ou're not free tomorrow, I believe Joshua will be giving an intro-to-Solidi=
ty talk through the CS club in the near future. It'll likely be better, or =
at least better organized. Lol.
