The video entitled "3. Asymptotic Analysis of 4 Comparison ..." is up on sa=
kai in a glitch-free version. I will now attempt to produce youtube videos =
for that.  =A0  You need to have viewed all 3 videos before tomorrow's clas=
s. Bring your questions about the material on the videos to class and ask t=
hem there. After those questions are answered we will move on to the exerci=
ses that appeared in the Asymptotic Analysis ppt as well as those in the 3 =
videos. Note that you are required to have worked on the summation exercise=
 in the Asymptotic Analysis ppt =A0before class and have brought that solut=
ion with you to class.
