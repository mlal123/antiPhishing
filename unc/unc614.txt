Hello Mangza,

 
I hope you have a good Fall Break and are great to finish the semester strong. I write to touch base with you to see how classes and life is going for you. I also want
 to try to schedule a time to meet with you in the next two weeks – perhaps over a meal.

 
Below are some dates, times and restaurant locations  to choose from  --- I will pay for our meal. If none of these times fit your
 schedule, do provide me 3-4 options of your availability between September 13 and September 18 (this includes Saturday and Sunday.) Again, if you are not available for lunch or dinner perhaps you can suggest a breakfast time (normally from 7:45 – 8:45 am at
 Ye Olde Waffle Shoppe on Franklin Street) or even a time for us to meet at the Daily Grind inside the Bookstore. We can also find a time to just meet me in my office.

 
Please respond by Thursday, October 29  regarding your availability and interest in meeting with me over a meal, remember it is on me.

Andrea earned her MS Ed in Higher Education from Southern Illinois University and a BS in Management Information Systems from Winston-Salem State University.
 Before coming to Carolina, she held student affairs positions at Duke University, The University of South Carolina and The University of Illinois. Andrea is an award-winning academic advisor who believes each student possesses a set of unique strengths, talents
 and abilities; each one needs to feel connected to the University, know how to find and use appropriate resources, and have the confidence to make their own life decisions.
Her calling is to inspire Carolina students to explore beyond the familiar, to engage fully in their curricular and co-curricular pursuits, and to empower them to envision greater possibilities. 
 Andrea lives in Durham and has a large and rambunctious extended family in Statesville, NC who she considers to be some of her greatest life teachers and beloved friends. During quiet times, you may find her reading a good book, listening to jazz music or
 watching well-written television shows.
