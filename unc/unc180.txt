BUSINESS ETIQUETTE TIP: TIPPING
[http://www.tripinsurance.com/tips/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/tipping-waite=
rs.jpg]

While dining out in a restaurant may already seem a stretch for your budget=
, it is expected that you will leave a 15-20% tip (unless the service is eg=
regiously poor!), so plan for this when you are going out to eat. Most serv=
ers (you may be one or may have been one at some time) are paid very low wa=
ges, and they count on receiving a tip.

Other occasions when you would tip are: Taking a taxi - generally 10%-15% o=
f the bill
Checking a bag with the skycap at an airport - typically $1-$2   per bag
Beauty/Barber shop - 15% of the bill unless your service is provided by the=
 owner, in which case no tip is required
Pizza delivery - $1-$2 if short distance; $2-$3 for longer distances; $5 or=
 more for large deliveries

Note that these suggestions are for the US. If traveling overseas, check a =
guide for the country or countries you will be visiting, as tipping customs=
 are often different.           ___________________________________________=
