  I just finished reading the Blogs for week 9.  It is great to=
 keep up to speed on what you are doing and, in some cases, what you are th=
inking.  The ones of you who take the blog seriously provide great ins=
ight into your experience this semester.  I have read all the blogs bu=
t I have only commented if there was something specific I needed to say.&nb=
sp; Recounting the weeks events is a good approach but I also enjoyed those=
 that went into something else you were thinking about or focused more deep=
ly on one subject.  Don't feel constrained when writing your blogs.&nb=
sp; Any subject is fair game and if you have something you specifically wan=
t feedback on, let me know in the blog.  Three of you did not submit=
 a  Week 9 blog as far as I can tell.  I communicated with each o=
f you.  This is very disappointing.    Buck  &=
