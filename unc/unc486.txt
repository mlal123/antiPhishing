We had planned to offer COMP 581H, Robotics, this spring but could not get
it approved in time.  If you have the credentials for taking COMP 581H
(prereqs are C or better in 401 and 410) and meet the requirements for
taking an honors course (a first year or SO, JR or SR with a GPA of 3.0 or
higher), you should contact Prof Alterovits for permission to register for
COMP 781.
