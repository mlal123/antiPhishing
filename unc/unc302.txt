From: Caroline Yang (yangcc) - yangcc@live.unc.eduHi Everyone, =
 I have added a document under your Resources tab on Sakai.  It is =
called TyposTest1Review.  There are typos in the answer key for proble=
ms 5, 7, and 32.  I have also written down work for the absolute value=
 problems (23, 24, 29-31) since the key works them out a little differently=
 than I showed in class.  Also, I will not be giving extra time beyo=
nd the 50 minutes of class to complete the test.  If you have any ques=
tions, please let me know.  -Caroline ----------------------<=
