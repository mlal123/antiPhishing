First meeting: This Sunday 5/20/2018
I was thinking of having our first floor meeting this coming Sunday around 4:00 pm. This will be me just introducing myself and going over expectations as well as meeting your hall-mates. This shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. If you absolutely cannot
 make it, please let me know.

Lastly, come to the upper quad tomorrow (just across the street, by the atm machines, where Mangum, Grimes, Ruffin are located) for some cold smoothies!

Thanks,
