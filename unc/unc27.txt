Dear Mangza Lal,

You are receiving this email because you have an on-campus housing assignme=
nt for the 2015-2016 academic year. We wanted to give you some information =
regarding the upcoming Room Refinement Period, during which you will have t=
he opportunity to make changes to your assignment.


*         Room Refinement will run from July 8th-July 31st. (We pushed back=
 the start date in an effort to make available as many prime spaces as poss=
ible.)

*         During this time, you may log in to your MyHousing portal, access=
 your 2015-2016 application, and click the Room Swap tab to browse availabl=
e room spaces in each building.

*         If you find an available space to which you'd like to move, you m=
ay reassign yourself to that space. You may reassign yourself as many times=
 as you'd like during this period.

o   NOTE: If space permits in the room/suite/apartment you've selected, our=
 system will allow you to "pull in" members of your roommate group (returni=
ng students) or your preferred roommate (new students) as indicated on your=
 2015-2016 application. Please discuss any roommate moves with the students=
 involved, and update the information on your application if necessary.

*         If you see or know of an available space, and the system will not=
 let you assign yourself to it, please contact our office so that we can tr=
oubleshoot the issue.

*         After July 31st, there will be NO FURTHER ROOM CHANGES until afte=
r the start of the semester, as we have to finalize building rosters for th=
e Community Directors and Resident Assistants.
