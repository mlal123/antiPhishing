Folks -- Since we have Fall Break later this week (yay! :) )...

We will not have office hours or labs on Thursday and Friday of this week.
We will also not have the Wednesday lab.  However, feel free to send us
questions through Piazza or the team email during the break.

See you in class tomorrow. We have a distinguished and popular speaker, Dr.
Gary Bishop, who has inspired every COMP 110 class in the last few years
with his talk about Enabling Technologies.  Don't miss this talk!
 (Attendance will be taken, and midterm feedback will be discussed as well).
