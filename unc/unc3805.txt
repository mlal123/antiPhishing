        Hello all,   =
  I have posted a final practice exam under the resources tab on Sakai. =
A few notes  (i) In a previous email, I mentioned the final would be=
 10-15 questions. That was an overestimate, as you will be able to see from=
 the practice exam.  (ii) As always, the practice exam is not exhaus=
tive but should give you an idea of the kind of problems you can expect to =
appear on the real final exam.  (iii) Solutions will be posted later=
 in the week.  Additionally, I am holding two Q/A review sessions be=
fore the final. These will be the same format as before the midterms.  =
(i) Sunday, Dec. 11th at 6-7pm in our regular room (Hanes 120)  (=
ii) Wednesday, Dec. 14th at 6-7pm in our regular room (Hanes 120)  &=
