*Short-Term Programming Job | Chapel Hill NC*

I am looking for a CS student interested in a short term programming job.
The task will be to develop code (preferably with a simple GUI) that will
extract some behavioral variables from motion tracking files used in our
animal behavior lab. These files are simple text files -- a time stamp with
an X,Y coordinate for each frame of a video. I anticipate the job taking
10-20 hours to complete. Pay is negotiable and hours are very flexible (you
can work whenever and from wherever you like), though I'd like to have the
product done within a week or two of hiring. Please contact Spencer Ingley
, NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow, for more details.

*Project w/KFBS Professor*

My name is Christina Synn and I'm an accounting professor at the

*TRU Deli | Chapel Hill, NC | App Dev Project*

We are working to launch delivery of TRU products to specific campus
checkpoints. To do so, I am looking for the development of a
location-based, real-time mobile app that can facilitate customers to order
with TRU based on proximity to a delivery checkpoint and estimated delivery
time (sort of like finding an Uber).

My boss, the owner of TRU, is a software developer but unfortunately both
his job and owning TRU keeps him too busy to develop the app himself.
However, he will be minimally involved for any input on the project. This
would be a paid position and would best be done by a small team of
individuals. Email your resume to Joseph Pietrafesa at
jpietrafesajr@gmail.com
