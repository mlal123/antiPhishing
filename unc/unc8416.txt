Stars on Staff

Our staff members at the Odum Institute are involved in all kinds of important research projects from across a range of disciplines. This week we're
shining a spotlight on two of them and what they've been up to lately. 

Paul Mihas - Co-authored "Understanding antagonism and synergism: A qualitative assessment of weight management in youth with T1DM diabetes" (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=36&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2NpZW5jZWRpcmVjdC5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9hcnRpY2xlL3BpaS9TMjQ1MTg0NzYxNzMwMDM5OCMh&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
)

Data for this study was collected from eight focus group discussions involving 34 participants (aged 12 - 17) who have lived with T1DM diabetes for
more than one year. The aim of the study was to characterize the experiences of participants in relation to their diagnoses and the barriers to weight
management that they have encountered. 

Teresa Edwards - Spearheading the data collection efforts of the Widowed Parent (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=36&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly93aWRvd2VkcGFyZW50Lm9yZy8%3D&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
) project. 

In 2011, Teresa was contacted by Drs. Donald Rosenstein (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=36&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly91bmNsaW5lYmVyZ2VyLm9yZy9tZWV0b3VyZG9jdG9ycy9yb3NlbnN0ZWlu&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
) and Justin Yopp (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=36&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkLnVuYy5lZHUvcHN5Y2gvZGlyZWN0b3JpZXMvZmFjdWx0eS9qdXN0aW4teW9wcA%3D%3D&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
) who were embarking on an effort to study a never-before researched population: widowed fathers recovering from the loss of their wives while trying
to solely parent their young children.
Rosenstein and Yopp had been leading a support group for widowed fathers, and wanted to collect data from a larger group in an effort to broaden their
understanding of the unique challenges facing this population. 
They turned to Teresa for assistance in developing and implementing an online survey fielded through a dedicated website. Over 400 men across the
country responded to the survey.
Now the team (which also includes Dr. Eliza M. Park (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=36&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly91bmNsaW5lYmVyZ2VyLm9yZy9wZW9wbGUvcHJvZmlsZXMvZWxpemEtbGVlemEtcGFyay0x&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
) and Ms. Allison Deal (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=36&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly91bmNsaW5lYmVyZ2VyLm9yZy9yZXNlYXJjaC9jb3JlLWZhY2lsaXRpZXMvYmlvc3RhdHMvYWxsaXNvbi1kZWFsLW1z&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
)) has expanded their work into a second survey for mothers and fathers whose co-parent has died of any cause within the past three years. The new
Widowed Parent (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=36&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly93aWRvd2VkcGFyZW50Lm9yZy9ob21l&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
) website houses the survey and provides resources for widowed parents. 
Rosenstein and Yopp started the widowed fathers support group because they could not find an existing group or resources for this population.
Similarly, when Teresa sought to find existing survey measures for this population, she found none. As a result, the group developed and published a
new scale, The Widowed Parenting Self-Efficacy Scale (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=36&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YW5kZm9ubGluZS5jb20vZG9pL2Ficy8xMC4xMDgwLzA3NDgxMTg3LjIwMTcuMTMzOTc0Mw%3D%3D&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
). 
Related: Rosenstein and Yopp have recently published a book (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=36&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cDovL3VuY2xpbmViZXJnZXIub3JnL25ld3MvdGhlLWdyb3VwLWJvb2s%3D&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
) about the support group, "The Group: Seven Widowed Fathers Reimagine Life (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=36&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Hcm91cC1TZXZlbi1XaWRvd2VkLUZhdGhlcnMtUmVpbWFnaW5lL2RwLzAxOTA2NDk1Njk%3D&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions

cross-tabulations (that is, custom data tables). Tools to be covered include: DataFerrett; iPUMS; TerraPopulus (in beta); and the Triangle Research
Data Center (TRDC).
The first three tools are freely available and we will focus on their census data content (U.S. for DataFerrett; U.S. and international for iPUMS and
TerraPopulus). Researchers must apply to the Census Bureau (or other federal agency, e.g., the Centers for Disease Control) for access to the TRDC in

*Mixed Methods Workshop

February 15, 16 | 10:00am - 4:00pm | Davis Library Room 3010
 This TWO-DAY course equips students to design, conduct, and critique mixed method research. From a pragmatic perspective, we will explore the
strengths and weaknesses of a variety of data collection methods, and evaluate strategies for combining them. We will focus on mixed method research
designs incorporating in-depth interviews, focus groups, participant observation, archival research, survey interviews, and/or hybrid methods.
The majority of the course will center on research design and data collection issues. Some time will be spent on strategies for analyzing and
presenting data from multiple sources.
This course is designed for those who are relatively new to mixed method research, and interested in the principles that should guide it. Participants
who come with a specific set of research questions in mind will have opportunities to apply topics of discussion to their own research ideas during
the workshop.
