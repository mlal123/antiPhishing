Lal, Mangza:
During reconciliation of the work-study program, we discovered that your account is close to exceeding your allotted earnings under the FWS program.  As you may be aware, earnings under this program are need-based, and any disbursement
 of federal funds beyond a student’s awarded amount constitutes a violation of program rules under U.S. Department of Education Regulations.  We congratulate you on your productivity under the work-study program, but we do ask that you take the necessary steps
 to remain in compliance with program rules.
You can find your reported earnings at the end of the most recent pay period, your total award allocation, and your remaining earnings eligibility for the academic year below. 
You should discuss your future work plans with your supervisor to ensure you do not work beyond your allotted time if you are still employed.
Thank you for your participation in the Federal Work Study program.  If you have any additional inquiries regarding this email, please feel free to reach our student employment office at
work-study@unc.edu.
