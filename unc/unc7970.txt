Hey Morrison Team,
 
Firstly, I wanted to follow up on Andrew Stone’s previous e-mail and to say hello. I also wanted to let you know that I am very much excited to work with you all this semester. For some of you that may not know me, I am the Community Director
 in Manning West and this is my second year here at UNC. I don’t want to bog you down with a lengthy e-mail, but do want to go over a couple things for the next couple days.

 
First, I completely recognize and understand the weather is bad and looks like it could continue to be bad. Thus I fully understand if your travel plans have been altered due to this. Please do not drive or travel if you feel that it will
 be unsafe. Your safety is the most important. Please let me know if you think that you will miss training or will be late because of this. I just would like a count before we start tomorrow. Thanks.

 
Second, tomorrow is training. For now, training is still on so we will plan to go with that until otherwise notified. Training starts at 9:30am. It will be very cold tomorrow and because of that we will meet inside
Morrison lobby at 9:05am to then walk over together with Manning West staff to the Union. There will be a roll call, so I would encourage you all go over on what you did for roll call for training
 in the Fall. 
 
Third, Monday evening at 6pm, we will have dinner together to get to know one another and talk a little more about how the semester will play out with staff meeting, 1-1’s etc. Pizza has already been ordered and should be a good time to
 just get to know one another better and for you to reconnect with the each other as a staff.

 
Lastly, I look forward to working with you all this semester. I recognize that this situation of having a CD split their time between two communities is not ideal, but I will do my best to serve you and the residents of Morrison to the
 best of my ability. All I ask for is a little patience, and understanding. We will talk a little more about this on Monday evening.

 
Please be safe out there on the roads and hopefully I get to see you all tomorrow.

 
Regards,
