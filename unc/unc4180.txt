   SHORT COURSE SPOTLIGHT
   
  
  
   
   =20

Short Course Spotlight: When and How to Use W=
eb SurveysThere are many different wa=
ys that samples can be obtained for online surveys and experiment. These in=
clude open invitation surveys of volunteers, intercept surveys, opt-in or a=
ccess panels, Amazon's Mechanical Turk, Google Consumer Surveys, list-based=
 samples, and the like. In almost all cases, the goal is to make inference =
to some larger population or process. These different approaches have stren=
gths and weaknesses. Understanding these is important to choosing the right=
 method for the research question, given available resources. The course wi=
ll review some of the inferential challenges, including sampling error, cov=
erage error, and non-response error. A variety of adjustment methods, such =
as weighting, propensity score adjustment and matching, are being used to m=
itigate the risk of inferential errors, and these will be reviewed, too. Th=
e course focuses on practical choices a researcher needs to make in choosin=
g a research method, in analyzing the data, and in describing the results o=
f the research. This course is suitable for people who are considering cond=
ucting a Web survey to collect data for research or analyzing data from a W=
eb survey.=20
  The Instructor: Dr. Mick Couper, from the U=
niversity of Michigan and the Joint Program in Survey Methodology, is the l=
eading authority on web survey design in the U.S. He is the author of Desig=
ning Effective Web Surveys (Cambridge, 2008), and co-author (with Roger Tou=
rangeau and Frederick Conrad) of The Science of Web Surveys (Oxford, 2013),=
 and has done extensive research on web survey design and implementation, u=
