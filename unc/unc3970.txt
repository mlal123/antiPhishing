Undergrad RA Opportunity Computer Vision Group: Motivated Undergraduate
student to work on building datasets to help robots understand our world.
The work will include driving a robot, and taking thousands of pictures,
around rooms that may be on or off campus. Ability to transport the robot
is useful but not required. The image collection process is a bit slow, so
patience and focus are vital. There is also an opportunity to add some
automation to this process, so any knowledge of C++, ROS, and/or programming
experience with multiple languages is a plus.
