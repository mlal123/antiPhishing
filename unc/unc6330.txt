Short Course Spotlights

Designing and Conducting Surveys of Businesses and Organizations with Diane Willimack and Chris Ellis

This course provides an overview of methodological issues associated with the use of surveys to collect data from organizations. We will identify key
differences between household surveys and organizational surveys, emphasizing organizational behaviors and attributes that affect survey response. 
We will demonstrate an approach to survey design that utilizes understanding and consideration of this organizational context when developing,
adapting, and implementing data collection instruments and procedures. This course will include topics related to survey planning, questionnaire
design and pretesting, data collection modes, and communication and response improvement strategies.
This course will count as 7.0 CPSM Short Course Credit hours.
Date: Thursday, September 21, 2017
Time: 9:00AM - 4:30PM
Location: 219 Davis Library

Data Collection Using Mobile Phones in Developing Countries: New Approaches with SMS, IVR, and CATI

The rapid growth of mobile phones in developing countries opens up new possibilities for data collection. Short message service (SMS), interactive
voice response (IVR), online surveys (web) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) can produce data faster and less expensively than
face-to-face surveys. This course will introduce students to the design and implementation of SMS, IVR, Web, and CATI surveys in low- and
middle-income countries.
In this course, Dr. Lau will draw from real world examples to illustrate how these modes work. We will also discuss basic survey design principles in
each mode, focusing on sampling, questionnaire development, and survey design. New for this year’s course: Students will work in small groups to
design questionnaires and collect data in real time via SMS and IVR using a free, open source survey tool.
This course will count as 4.0 CPSM Short Course Credit hours.
