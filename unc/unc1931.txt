In the last two years, we have significantly increased the number of
undergraduates helping out in introductory courses.  We choose to use the
term "learning assistant" (or LA) for this position because their goal is
to help students in the class learn the material.  We recognize how
important these students have been to our ability to teach this material
and therefore are introducing a new award: LA of the Year.

Please help us by nominating the LA (or LAs) that have made a difference
for you this year.  If you would like to nominate an LA, please fill
in the google
form  to nominate them.  It's not hard:
 all I ask for is a name and a sentence.

Nominations are due by midnight at the end of the month (Saturday, April 30)

Let the voting begin!
