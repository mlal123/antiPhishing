From: Logan Tatham (ltatham) - ltatham@live.unc.eduClass,  I have just uploaded the course grades to Connect Carolina, so you can see what grade you got in the course now. There should be no surprises, except for a couple of you on the cusp of the next grade whom I have bumped up.  Teaching you all has been a real treat. Again, feel free to keep in touch with me.
