You are receiving this email because you are enrolled in COMP 411.002 Fall 2016.  Computer Organization is a 4 credit course.  I neglected to schedule this course for the appropriate amount of hours (leaving off the lab).  A lab has recently been added which will meet on Thursday's at 3:30 after Thursday's lecture in SN014.  Those of you without conflicts have been enrolled in this second meeting pattern.  If you do see any issues that I can help with, please contact me.
