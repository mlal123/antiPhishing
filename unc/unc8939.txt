***NEW*** COMP 590 Real-Time Systems (Catherine Nemitz)
This introduction to real-time systems begins with grouping such systems
under several fundamental classifications.  We develop a model to reason
about these systems and cover a sampling of scheduling algorithms for
uniprocessor systems.  Of these algorithms, we will prove a test for each
that ensures the desired system behavior.  As a means of introducing some
of the complexities in real systems, students will implement simulations of
several scheduling algorithms.  We will also cover limited preemption models
and an introduction to multiprocessor scheduling.  This course builds on
the reasoning skills developed in COMP 283/MATH 381 and COMP 550, as well
as knowledge of basic computer architecture covered in COMP 411.  This
course will also give an introduction to some basic concepts of operating
systems.

COMP 523 Recitation sections:  These are the meeting times for
instructor-team meetings and therefore define the team that you will be
working with for the semester.  If you are part of a team that wants to
work together, you must all register for the same section.
