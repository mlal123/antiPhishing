Good morning all!

We have two companies that calendars have opened in Careerolina for mock
technical interviews. Since space is limited (only 6 students per company),
I'm only allowing students to sign up for *ONE mock interview per semester
unless otherwise stated.* This means that if you are on the mock interview
calendar for Google on October 10th, *you will not* sign up for one of
these interviews.

*Coding Interview Practice with United Health: Oct 24*
*Coding Interview Practice with Infusion: Oct 27 *

*Directions to sign up:*

   - Sign up in Careerolina
   
   - Make sure your account profile is up to date and you have a resume
   uploaded. (you won't be able to register if you don't have a resume or you
   are not listed as CS in the system)
   - Use the "Search all jobs/internships/OCI positions" tab on the left of
   your homepage.
   - Use the search function and type in either the company name or "coding
   interview practice" to see both options.
