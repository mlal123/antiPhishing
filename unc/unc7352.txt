I'll be in SN011 at 5 this evening to talk about independent studies,
learning contracts, research and the new structures that I'm putting in
place.  The updated forms will be available by Thanksgiving and I will not
accept any old forms.

Please try to make the meeting if you are interested in topics.  I hope to
be able to answer individual questions.
