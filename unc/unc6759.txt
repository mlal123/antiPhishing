From: McNair Mitchener (mcnairhm) - mcnairhm@live.unc.eduHi Everyone<=
/p>  A preliminary business model canvas is due before the coaching s=
ession on October 17 and after the session you can incorporate comments in =
your final submission due by 11:59  that night.  Some coaches may=
 request you submit the canvas in advance so they can review it before clas=
s.  For the preliminary canvas do a deep dive on two or three boxes an=
d fill in the remainder as best you can at this point.  Focus on custo=
mer segment, value proposition and one other box that combine to make your =
approach different.  Fill in the other boxes as best you can.  At=
 this point we are looking for evidence that you have thought about the mod=
el and are doing more than just checking boxes.  You do not need to co=
mplete the cost structure box until after we provide you additional  &=
nbsp;guidance in class for that part of the canvas.  That will take pl=
ace during class 21 on October 31.   The canvas template is avail=
able in the resources tab of sakai under the final project folder. Open the=
 word document and complete your work, but again, submissions will lose poi=
nts if they are submitted in non-PDF formats.  There is no class tomor=
row due to University Day.  The class time is a great opportunity for =
your team to work on this, if you aren't going to the ceremony.  All t=
he best, and have a nice weekend!  MHM BMC Te=
