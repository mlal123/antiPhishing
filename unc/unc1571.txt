Dear Mangza Lal,
 
Thi=
s week, we have completed the first round of the room selection process. We=
 hope that most of you were able to select spaces in one of your top choice=
 halls and are excited to return to on-campus housing next year. We do real=
ize, however, that this process can be stressful and frustrating if you wer=
e not able to select the hall/room type you wanted and/or be with your pref=
erred roommate or group.
 
As =
the Spring Semester moves forward, we expect to have many spaces open up fo=
r various reasons. That is why we are happy to offer a 4-week period of Room Refinement, and then a Housing Waitlist.
 
ROOM REFINEMENT=

The=
 Room Refinement period will be open from Monday, February 22nd to Friday, March 18th<=
/B>. During this period, students may log back into their housing applicati=
on, browse room availability, and change their assignment as many times as =
they=92d like. Because the system will be live 24/7, openings may come avai=
lable at any time, so unfortunately, we are not able to notify students whe=
n a room they want opens up. 
 
HOUSING WAITLIST
On =
March 21st at 9:00 a.m=
., we will open the Housing Waitlist. Information about the waitlist ca=
n be found at http://housing.unc.edu/housings=
election/waitlist. The links for both the i=
ndividual and group waitlist will be added to this page when it opens, so w=
e encourage you to add yourself and/or your group. As spaces become availab=
le, we will fill them from the waitlist in order of signup time. If we can =
offer you/your group a space, we will send you an email offer, and you will=
 be required to accept or decline within 24 hours. If you do not hear from =
us, it is safe to assume that we have not yet been able to offer you a spac=
e.
 
Tha=
nk you again for your patience with the 2016-2017 Selection Process. Please=
 remember that Fall Opening is 6 months away, and a lot of changes will hap=
pen during that time. We promise to work as hard as we can to help you get =
into a room that meets your needs.
