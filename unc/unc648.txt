First Year Students:

The spring 2016 First Year Seminars (FYS) brochure is posted on the FYS web=
site (http://fys.unc.edu/courses/spring-2016/) under the "Courses" tab, and=
 we will update it to reflect any changes.  If you were not enrolled in a F=
YS in the fall semester, you can register for a spring FYS beginning Wednes=
day, November 11 at your registration appointment time.  To find your regis=
tration appointment, log in to the Connect Carolina Student Center, select =
"Details" under Enrollment Dates, and select Spring 2016 term. You can add =
FYS to your Shopping Cart, but remember that this does not register you for=
 a seat. Your top choice FYS may fill quickly, so you should put several FY=
S in your Shopping Cart.

If you were enrolled in a FYS in the fall semester, you may register for a =
spring FYS beginning at 12:01am on Monday, November 16.  Your top choice FY=
S may be filled, but keep an open mind. Each FYS is a wonderful opportunity=
 to explore potentially interesting new territory, and many students change=
 their major based on their positive experience in a FYS!
The FYS Program provides a unique academic opportunity within the broader c=
urriculum. FYS are small (no more than 24 students), taught by our best ins=
tructors, and address topics that are on the frontier of scholarship or res=
earch. FYS give you the opportunity to work together with faculty and class=
mates in a shared experience that provides a hands-on preview of the exciti=
ng work of engaged scholarship at Carolina.
If you have questions regarding registering for FYS, please contact your ac=
ademic advisor or Curriculum Director Nick Siedentop (Nick_siedentop@unc.ed=
u, 962-5819).
