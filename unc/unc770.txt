The department will be hosting 23 teams for the ACM Mid-Atlantic Regional
Programming Contest this Saturday and is in desperate need for student
volunteers to help run the event. We need 2-3 volunteers to help set up
between 8:30 and the start of the contest at 12 and 4-5 volunteers from the
start of the contest to the end of the day around 5.

Volunteers will help deliver printouts to the teams, blow up helium
balloons used to keep track of which teams have solved which problems,
restock the snack table and help set up for lunch and dinner, and generally
be available to help our staff out. You=E2=80=99ll get a nifty t-shirt, we=
=E2=80=99ll feed
you (lunch and dinner), and you=E2=80=99ll be very much appreciated.

If you=E2=80=99ve done the contest in the past, consider this your opportun=
ity to
pay back all those volunteers who helped run the event when you did it. If
you=E2=80=99ve never done the contest, this is a great way to see it in act=
ion and
to consider if you might want to do it in the future.

If you can help out, please send email ASAP to kmp@cs.unc.edu.

Thanks!
