From: McNair Mitchener (mcnairhm) - mcnairhm@live.unc.eduUse the attached map to find your team number when you arrive and sit in groups in the morning. It will be displayed on the screen, but take a look now to save some confusion at the start of class.  It's a tight fit in the classroom as we are almost at seat capacity, so don't leave spaces between groups.  See you in class!
