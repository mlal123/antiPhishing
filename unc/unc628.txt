			Ever wonder what life would be like as a certain =
major? Wonder about how you can fit it all in?
		
			 
		
			We had a hunch. Beginning on October 26, Academic Advisin=
g has teamed up with faculty members across campus to bring you the Major Exploration Workshop Series.  Science =
and math majors are up first, but don’t worry, social science and hum=
anities workshops are coming this spring! 
		
			 
		
			During these workshops, you’ll have the chance to:<=
/span>
		
			 
		
			
				
					Learn about more than 22 science, math, and allied heal=
th majors
			
			
				
					Get to know faculty members and what kinds of opportuni=
ties are available in their department AND…
			
			
				
					Learn how it can all fit into your academic plan. 
			
		
		
			 
		
			Co-facilitated by academic advisors and faculty members, =
workshops will be about an hour long and will focus first on the informatio=
n you need to know about a particular major and then on how you can use adv=
ising resources to build your academic plan.

tion, attending one will fulfill your first-year advising meeting requireme=
nt. Sound good? We think so, too.
