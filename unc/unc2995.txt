1) check the class web site... the Poll links have been u[dated to include questions from the past two classes.  Use them as study material

2) I have posted some midterm information under the exam tab 

3) in Piazza I have created a "muddiest" folder.
Please post questions and/or comments in there telling me the muddiest points from each class day.  I will do what I can to clear things up, and/or revisit points in subsequent class meetings
