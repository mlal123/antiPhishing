Good morning everyone!

Thank you all for your help demoing and volunteering at the Open House on
Saturday! We have heard nothing but wonderful feedback from attendees about
the event, the demos, and the guidance they received from students. As all
of our pictures show, kids and parents were all enthralled by the demos and
the work that is being done in the department. Thank you again for doing
such a great job, making the department look so great to hundreds of people
and helping us with this event. We couldn't do it without you!

Have a wonderful fall break!

Best,
Hope
