Hi all -

It's almost time for 2016 W-2s!  Here are a few important things to note -


   - Paper W-2s for *active employees* will be available for pickup in my
   office next week.  *If you do not pick up your paper W-2 from me by
   April 18th, it will be shredded.*
   - Paper W-2s for *inactive employees* will be mailed by January 31st to
   the last known home address on file in ConnectCarolina.
   - *For both active and inactive employees, you will be able to access
   your W-2 electronically via ConnectCarolina beginning on Monday, 1/30.*
    Inactive employees will need to register for a Guest ID if they have not
   already done so previously.
   - *This year in ConnectCarolina there is an additional authentication
   step called 2-Step Verification.*  You may go ahead and register for
   2-Step Verification now so you don't have to do that next week when you are
   trying to access your W-2.
