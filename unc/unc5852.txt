Hi all -

Congrats on your job in the department of Computer Science for Fall
2017!  *Before
you begin working*, there are a few things we need you to do in advance
that involve tax paperwork and completing an I-9.

I have attached the following documents to this email -

   - Employee Info form
   - Direct deposit form
   - I-9 acceptable document list

Please print out the first two items and fill them out.  You may enter your
tax information (W-4 and NC-4) online in ConnectCarolina via the
self-service menu - international students, you have different tax forms
which I have attached (W-4 and NC-4 NRA).

Please review the I-9 acceptable document list and decide what forms of
identification you will present. * IF YOU DO NOT HAVE PROPER IDS, WE CANNOT
HIRE YOU AND YOU MAY NOT WORK.*  Please note on the I-9 list that you may
present either (one ID from column A) OR (one ID from column B AND one ID
from column C).  *You must bring the original ID - we cannot use
photocopies or scans of your ID.*

*If you are an international student - please bring your passport, your
I-94, and your I-20.  You must also complete paper tax forms, which I have
attached (W-4 and NC-4 NRA).*

Bring the employee info form, the direct deposit form *(with a voided check*),
and your ID(s) for the I-9 to see either myself, Robin Brennan, or Jodie
Gregoritsch.  I've listed our offices below - we are typically in the
building Monday through Friday from 8 am to 5 pm, but if you get here and
one of us is at lunch someone else is probably still available for you.

Beth Mayo - SN (Sitterson) 149
Robin Brennan - SN (Sitterson) 106
Jodie Gregoritsch - FB (Brooks) 142

*You need to bring the forms, your voided check, and your IDs to see one of
us before you can start work this fall. * Your professors (and supervisors
if you are work study) have been alerted that you are not allowed to work
until this has been taken care of.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Remember, you cannot begin
working (and thus get paid!) until this is taken care of.

Thanks,

Beth
