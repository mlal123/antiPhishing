Hi everyone,
 
I hope this email finds your Monday off to a great start. After a math l=
ecture that combined gratuitous use of the word "shit" and a=
 reference to the derivative as "the d word," how can i=
t not be...?
 
I'm in your MATH 231 class and I thought about creating a listserv/study=
 group that could be used to get help from one another on Webassign and&nbs=
p;potentially review for exams/final, if there is interest in that.

 
If you are interested, if you could reply to me directly before class to=
morrow, I will add you to the My Limit Doesn't Exist listserv.

 
Cheers,
Julian
