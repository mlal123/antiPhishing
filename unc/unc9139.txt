From: Buck Goldstein (goldstb) - buck_goldstein@unc.eduI have enjoy=
ed your blogs for week 10 and in some cases week 11.  Let's make week =
11 the last required blog. After the week 11 submission concentrate on your=
 final project.  You have an outline and  hopefully we have =
a schedule by now (I haven't checked it lately) so concentrate on making th=
e final project awesome.  I am traveling across the country to view it=
.  Make it worth the trip.  The proposed outline for the final pr=
oject should be viewed as a suggested framework but not a rigid requirement=
.  If you want to come out of the box, great.    Coul=
d one or two of you figure out how to get lunch brought in for the two days=
.  That will give us more time to talk and will work better than a gro=
up dinner, I think. Let me know who is going to do that and if you need a c=
redit card number to charge the lunches in advance I can give you one. =
 I look forward to seeing you all soon.  Buck ------------=
