It depends.  There are several ways to advance to Math231 (or 232=
)

Did you get a 3 or higher on the Calc BC exam?  If so, you have cr=
edit for Math 231 and Math 232 and can go straight to Math 233, or quit tak=
ing math, or retake either of Math 231 or Math 232 if you really want to, b=
ut I don=92t recommend retaking them. Did you get a 3 or high=
er as your AB subscore on the Calc BC test, or on the Calc AB test?  I=
f so, you have credit for Math 231 and and can go straight to Math 232, or =
can retake Math 231 if you want to (sometimes students do with a 3)Did you get a 2 on either the Calc BC or the AB subscore for the Calc BC, =
or the Calc AB test?  If so, then you can take Math 231. Did you get a 600 or higher on the Math II SAT subject test?  If so, =
you can go straight to Math 231Did you get a 29 or higher on the m=
ath part of the ACT test? If so , you can go straight to Math 231.
If none of these apply to you, then I would suggest you take or retake=
 the Math II SAT subject test (or the ACT test if you prefer) .  There=
 is one on Nov 7th and sometimes they take drop-ins, or you can sign up to =
take it Dec. 5th.  Check when the scores
 will be back =97 if it is before the semester starts you are good, and if =
it is a few days after the semester starts talk to me and we can figure out=
 what to do. 


The only other placement option is the department=92s calculus placeme=
nt test.  This is offered on Friday Jan 8th.  But that can only g=
et you OUT of calculus, not INTO calculus, so I don=92t know if that would =
work for you.  In particularly, they don=92t give
 you course credit, only placement credit.

Hey Professor Green! I am a first-year student who is majoring in  =
computer science and need to take math 231 and  currently I am taking =
Math 110 (apparently I wasn't suppose to but, miscommunications happen=
ed) and now I would have to take math 130 before
 I can take math 231, 
I've already taken Calculus BC my junior year in highschool  and
 I have a lot of math class requirements to take so I'd prefer to not have =
to take precalculus that I've already taken 3 years ago. Is there any way I=
 can get exemption from math department for math 130 and to be able to take=
 math 231 next spring?
(Sorry I didn't really know who to  email! my Advisor just said I s=
hould just email one of the math 231 teachers about this)
