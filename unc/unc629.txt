elopment and launch of an idea that helps to connect people with others to =
support the achievement of their physical
 fitness goals. Often a person would like to go to the gym or work towards =
improving their physical fitness but they don't for a range of reasons. The=
se include not wanting to go to the gym alone, moving to a new place and lo=
sing their fitness network, being
 unsure of how to perform exercises, or not knowing how to develop a fitnes=
s plan for their specific goals. Some people do begin but eventually give u=
p on their fitness goals due to life commitments or not having a support sy=
stem. This is the genesis of my
 idea.



My idea is an app (and a companion website=
) that would allow you to create a profile and list your fitness level (beg=
inning, intermediate, advanced...and more
 information) and help connect you to others that are also looking for fitn=
ess support. This is accomplished through smartphone GPS technology (so som=
ething like Uber but developed for fitness).  The model for this also =
works for those that are already pretty
 active looking for others with whom they can train (e.g. runners, Tough Mu=
dders, bikers, etc). 


I was fortunate to have gotten my start in=
 entrepreneurship at Carolina and to have used that start to lead ventures =
to success (e.g. Nominated for 2012 White
 House Champions for Change Award, Inducted into UNC's Order of the Golden =
Fleece, Awarded the 2013 Emerging Issues Prize for Innovation, Awarded 2013=
 Triangle Business Journal Top 40 Under 40 Entrepreneur award, etc). I'm in=
terested having some people join
 the team and help make this a success. Upcoming funding opportunities for =
this idea are the Carolina Challenge, pitching to Hatteras Ventures (who sp=
ecializes in early stage investments), the 2016 Emerging Issues Prize for I=
nnovation, and Triangle Business
 Journal's Healthcare Heroes.

jewooten@email.unc.edu AND julian.wooten@gmail.com (I get a lot of emails s=
o I want to be sure that I receive it). 


I look forward to hearing from you and pot=
entially working together.
