From: Dylan Glotzer (dglotzer) - dglotzer@live.unc.eduHello all,  I've posted the solutions to the practice problems.  Note that neither the problems nor the solutions contain a copy of the normal probability table (Table B.1 in the book). This WILL be provided to you for the exam.  As always, if you have any questions, please let me know.  Best,  DG ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "STOR155.001.FA16" site.
