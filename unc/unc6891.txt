Summer Analyst Internship

The Summer Analyst Internship program provides undergraduates an opportunit=
y to learn about and contribute to the work done by the Research and Statis=
tics Group.   Over the course of the summer, our economists-whose specialti=
es include banking and payment systems, capital markets, international econ=
omics, macroeconomics, and microeconomics-work closely with Summer Analysts=
 on long-term, academically orientated research projects as well as current=
 public policy work. In addition to their daily responsibilities, summer an=
alysts attend events and weekly presentations hosted by senior management. =
These presentations provide a broad and extensive overview of the Bank's re=
sponsibilities and operations. In addition to serving as a prime learning o=
pportunity for undergraduates interested in economic research, the summer a=
nalyst program also establishes a strong pool of candidates for recruitment=
 into the full-time Research Analyst position at the FRBNY upon graduation.
We seek candidates who have records of superior scholarship and academic cu=
riosity.  Summer Analysts usually come from strong economics, policy, mathe=
matics, or computer science backgrounds, though a major in one of these fie=
lds is not a necessity.  Successful candidates often have previous research=
 experience, and many are considering careers in economic research, public =
policy, or other related fields.
 In addition, we seek candidates from a wide range of backgrounds that are =
typically underrepresented in economics.  It is important to us that we suc=
ceed in recruiting a diverse cohort of summer analysts each year. Thus we e=
ncourage many students with varying experiences and backgrounds to apply. A=
s a representative of your institution and student body, we ask that you pl=
ease help us in passing this message along to any candidates you may know w=
ho may be otherwise hesitant to apply.
 Attached to this email, you will also find a brochure with details about t=
he full-time Research Analyst position, which the Summer Analyst position i=
s largely modeled after. Applications for the Summer Analyst position are b=
eing accepted now at http://www.newyorkfed.org/careers/current_opportunitie=
s.html. Applicants are strongly encouraged to apply by November 1.
