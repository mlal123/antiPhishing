UNC Qualtrics users now have access to the SMS distribution module (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=25&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucXVhbHRyaWNzLmNvbS9zdXBwb3J0L3N1cnZleS1wbGF0Zm9ybS9kaXN0cmlidXRpb25zLW1vZHVsZS9tb2JpbGUtZGlzdHJpYnV0aW9ucy9zbXMtc3VydmV5cy8%3D&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions
). While the license fee is paid by the university, an individual must pre-purchase an allotment of text messages for their account in order to
distribute surveys via SMS.
The minimum allotment of text messages available for purchase is 50,000 messages for $500, paid directly to Qualtrics. Therefore, minimum cost to
access the SMS module is $500. Text allotments are user-specific and cannot be shared with other users, but they never expire once purchased.
From within the Qualtrics interface, the SMS module allows the user to text Qualtrics survey links to any mobile number within or outside the U.S.,
provided the owner of the device has given prior express consent.
Two-way functionality is also available within the U.S. or the U.K. Two-way SMS allows survey questions and answers to be transmitted one question at
a time over separate SMS messages, but may not be used to collect sensitive data.
For questions about capabilities of the SMS module, see the Qualtrics SMS support page (
http://odum.unc.edu/?email_id=25&user_id=12564&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucXVhbHRyaWNzLmNvbS9zdXBwb3J0L3N1cnZleS1wbGF0Zm9ybS9kaXN0cmlidXRpb25zLW1vZHVsZS9tb2JpbGUtZGlzdHJpYnV0aW9ucy9zbXMtc3VydmV5cy8%3D&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions

Short Course Spotlight

Nonresponse from the Total Survey Error Perspective: An Overview

The Total Survey Error (TSE) paradigm embodies the best principles, strategies, and approaches for minimizing the survey error from all sources within
time, costs, and other constraints that can be imposed on the survey. This approach can be viewed as resting on the four pillars of survey
methodology: survey design, implementation, evaluation, and data analysis. 
This course provides an overview of the TSE paradigm as it applies to one critical source of error: nonresponse. Structured around these four pillars,
the course presents the best methods and lessons learned for dealing with nonresponse in survey, data collection, data analysis and evaluation. The
survey focuses particularly on the interactions of response mechanism with other error sources and how nonresponse interventions can lead to
unintended consequences for TSE.
Instructor: Paul Biemer
