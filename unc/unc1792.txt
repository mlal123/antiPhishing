From: Jay Smith (jaysmith) - jaysmith@email.unc.eduAnd I'm not talk=
ing about the basketball game....  Tomorrow we have our final quiz (=
yay!) and I'm also asking you to read two documents before coming to class.=
 We'll be talking about the English Revolutions (one in 1642, the other in =
1688) tomorrow, and the documents I'm asking you to read come from the firs=
t conflict, a Revolution carried out against royal "despotism" an=
d in favor of the "rights" of English citizens--though, as you wi=
ll see in the second document (the so-called Putney debates), there were di=
sagreements about the extent and nature of those rights. The English Revolu=
tion of the 1640s was propelled by a Parliamentary-backed (for the most par=
t) new kind of army that arose out of dissatisfaction with the fiscal and t=
heological "abuses" of the reigning monarch, Charles I. These two=
 documents were drafted by leaders of that army, and they show how remarkab=
ly advanced English political thinking had become by the 1640s--in some way=
s "too" advanced (as in...ahead of its time.) More on this tomorr=
ow. See the syllabus for details about the documents. --------------=
