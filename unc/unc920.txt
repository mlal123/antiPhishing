Dear Suite 711 Residents, 
During health & safety inspections, we found many personal belongings in your suite bathroom. As a note, housekeeping is unable to efficiently do their job in ensuring that you have a clean space in your shared
bathroom, if your personal belongings are overwhelmingly present. It’s okay to have hand soap for people to wash their hands after using the
bathroom or air freshener (i.e. Lysol), however, personal belongings for each individual suitemate on the shelves/counters and such should not be kept in the
bathroom. 
In the future, please make sure that your personal belongings are kept in your individual rooms and only brought to the
bathroom for use and brought back to your rooms after usage. Please know that a second violation in the winter will lead to a meeting with the Community Director.
If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to let me know.

Thank you,
Deanna Zhong, Hinton James Community Manager
