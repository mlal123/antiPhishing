Hey everyone,

I just wanted to give you guys a heads up / reminder that we're gonna be
having our first one on one's tomorrow. I plan on talking about current
project state and specific targets for next week. This week I'm also
planning on discussing scheduling, so that everyone has access to myself

I'll be happy to discuss any concerns you may have.
