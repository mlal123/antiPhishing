The 3rd of the 3 videos on creation and solution of recurrence relations is=
 now up on sakai. It is entitled "5. Recurrence solns via recursion trees .=
..". I believe it has no glitches -- email me if you find any. All three vi=
deos are now viewable, but the first one still has glitches that you can sk=
ip past without losing much. I intend to make that first video glitch free =
shortly and replace the present one. =A0There are worksheets and class exer=
cises at various places in the videos, not just at their ends.  =A0 =A0Step=
