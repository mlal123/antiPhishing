From: Dylan Glotzer (dglotzer) - dglotzer@live.unc.eduHello all,  Quick reminder to please bring a blue book=E2=80=8B =
to the final exam on Friday.  Additionally, a few students pointed o=
ut to me that I had left out linear combinations of random variables and th=
e continuity correction for the binomial approximation to normal on the lis=
t of topics on Sakai (under Resources --> Final). I have updated the lis=
t to include them.  As always, let me know if there any questions or=
 issues.  Best,  DG    -------------------=
