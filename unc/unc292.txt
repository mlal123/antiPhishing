Hello UNC!

Square is excited to be on campus this Thursday, 9/10 at 5:30pm in
Sitterson Hall for a tech talk. Kat Hawthorne, recent UNC alum, will be
giving a talk titled "Thinking Beyond Object-Oriented Programming" which
will cover the topics of how we built the square retail iOS app and how it
deviates from the typical patterns you are taught in school.

Looking forward to seeing you all there!

We hope you can make it!

Cheers,
Square
