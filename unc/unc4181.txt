    The Odum Institute will be presenting 3 addition=
al short courses at the end of February that were not listed in the previou=
s email.Introduction to the QG=
IS Open Source Software: Part 1Th=
is will be the first of two 2-hour hands-on workshops using the QGIS open s=
ource GIS package. This first workshop will begin with an overall introduct=
ion to the "OSGEO Stack" of open source GIS tools, including QGIS=
, GRASS, R, and other tools. Then we will explore the QGIS software, which =
can run on Windows, Mac, or Linux environments, runs in over 40 languages, =
and includes vector, raster, georegistration, and other capabilities, all u=
sing ESRI shapefiles as the basic vector data structure and Geotiffs as the=
 basic raster data structure. The first workshop will be a general introduc=
tion to the QGIS user interface and will explore the various elementary fun=
ctions, loading vector and raster data, etc. Additional tutorials and data =
will be made available to the participants so you can continue to work on y=
our own. Feel free to bring your laptop so you can download the software, t=
utorials, and data, or use a computer in the lab. =20

Date: February 20, 2017Time: 10:00 - 12:00 p.m. Instructor: Scott Madry Introduction to the QGIS Open Source Software: Part 2The second class will continue the introduction to=
 the QGIS software. We will explore various plugins, including live linking=
 OpenStreetMaps and Bing maps and images, creating cartographic maps using =
the composer cartographic interface, working with vector attribute tables, =
and downloading and working with raster satellite imagery. Web resources wi=
ll be explored. Additional tutorials and data will be made available to the=
 participants so you can continue to work on your own. Feel free to bring y=

Date: February 22, 2017Time: 10:00 - 12:00 p.m. Instructor: Scott Madry Introduction to the GRASS Open Source GIS and image processing softwar=
eThis third 2-hour workshop will =
cover the GRASS GIS package, which is included in the QGIS download and can=
 be used either as a set of integrated tools in the QGIS environment, or ru=
n as the stand-alone GRASS package. GRASS is the original open source GIS p=
ackage, and is a very powerful and integrated GIS, image processing, spatia=
l analysis, visualization and modeling environment. The first hour of a the=
 workshop will use GRASS within the QGIS environment, where data can be use=
d as GRASS files in the same environment as QGIS shapefiles, and can be con=
verted easily between the two. The current QGIS software can now call all o=
f the GRASS functions (over 400) remotely and does raster and vector data f=
ormat conversion on the fly. In the second hour we will use GRASS in its st=
and-alone configuration. Additional tutorials and data will be made availab=
le to the participants so you can continue to work on your own. Feel free t=
o bring your own laptop so you can download the software, tutorials, and da=
ta, or use a computer in the lab. =20
