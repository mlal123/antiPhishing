*Good morning and happy Thursday! *

Just a quick reminder before I outline some info and tips regarding the
career fairs next week. SQUARE is in Sitterson Hall today! You can visit
them now until 2pm in the lower lobby for pastries and resume tips. They
will be back this evening for their Tech Talk presented by two of our very
own CS alum.

*OK...I've got one question for you all...Are you ready for the career
fairs next week???*

We have *over 65 unique employers in two days* that want to hire CS
students for both jobs and internships! Use the tips below to tackle both
of these events like a pro:

   - *Do you have an updated resume ready for print?*
      - If you need a resume review, please stop by the 2nd floor of Hanes
      Hall, M-F between 1-4pm or call 919-962-2197 to schedule an appointme=
nt.
      - Print on white or cream colored paper and bring more than enough
      copies to give to employers.
      - Bring a padfolio (or folder) to keep them together and unwrinkled.


   - *Have you figured out who you want to talk to on either or both days?*
      - Use these links to view the list of employers, contact info, and
      basics about the company and opportunities here:

   - *Have you done a little research about the companies and jobs of
   interest?*
      - See if the company has a job posted in careerolina.
      - Visit the company website and learn a little about the company.
      - Visit the company's career website to see all their
      jobs/internships.
      - Add info to your cheat sheet to remind you of what you will ask
      each employer.


   - *Have you perfected your 30 second introduction?*
      - You don't want to walk up to the recruiter and say "what are you
      hiring for?" Instead, you want to walk up and confidently introduce
      yourself.
      - Include your name, year, major, skills/interest area, and ask a
      question.
      - EXAMPLE:
         - *Hi, my name is Jennifer and I'm currently a sophomore working
         on my Computer Science degree and minor in Economics. I'm
really interested
         in integrating the skills I've learned in computer science with th=
e
         knowledge I've gained from my minor. I see that Fidelity has
an internship
         program geared towards sophomores in CS and think my skills
and interest
         would be a good fit. Can you tell me more about the skills
and experiences
         you look for and a bit about the application process?*
      - TIP: Don't start with the employer you are most interested in. Warm
      up first! Approach an employer that is not on your priority list and
      practice your introduction.
      - TIP: Ask for their business card at the conclusion of your
      conversation and follow-up with anyone you are interested in within t=
he
      next 24-48 hours. Just a quick email thanking them for their
time, (remind
      them where you met), and reiterating your interest. Attach your
resume for
      their convenience but be sure you follow their specific application
      directions!


   - *Have you chosen what you will wear?*
   - Even though the tech industry can sometimes be casual, remember that
      you are not yet IN that industry. I highly suggest wearing
business casual
      to business attire to the CSIT Fair to show the employers that you ar=
e
      putting in an effort. Let me share some direct quotes I got from last
      year's CSIT fair employers about the way students were dressed:


   - *"**We saw a mix of how students were dressed, ranging from athletic
         shorts & a t-shirt to business professional. Generally IT is
a more relaxed
         environment, but maybe some standards, like khakis and a
polo, would be a
         helpful guide for some students!"*


   -

*" There was a wide variance in how students presented themselves. Some
         were in business attire and some were in shorts and a
t-shirt. I certainly
         don't expect everyone to have a suit or other business
attire, but even
         khakis and a button down shirt would be enough - just show an effo=
rt."*

*Ladies, use this as a guide when choosing what you will wear to the fair:*

*Gentlemen, **use this as a guide when choosing what you will wear to the
fair:*

self-confidence is preparation." ~Arthur Ashe
