Help sessions are nominally located in SN 006. However, that room is shared=
 with help sessions for some other courses, so look out for a note on the d=
oor that a particular comp 550 help session has been moved to another room.=
 Also, if an LA =A0finds it possible to move a session in a standing way to=
 another room, that fact will appear on the comp 550 google calendar (which=
 is now being formed). The help sessions will commence tomorrow, Friday 25 =
August.
