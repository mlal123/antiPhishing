Actually, they=92re neither; they=92re just the names of di=
fferent parts of the choral odes.  If you know how a song can have dif=
ferent sections that have different names (chorus, refrain, verse, etc.), s=
trophe and antistrophe work the same way for
 the songs that the chorus sang.  In actual performance you wouldn=92t=
 see the terms at all; they appear only in the written text.  Does tha=
t make sense?
