From: Ray Wang (raywang) - raywang@live.unc.eduHi All,  In addition to submitting the pivot deliverable on Thursday, you should also resubmit the MVP deliverable from last week, unchanged, as well as the actual MVP. If your MVP is a webpage/social media page, please submit the URL as well as a few snapshots of the website and a description of how it works. Similarly, if it is a mobile app/newsletter/text messages, send screenshots of the messages received, etc. Finally, if it is not digital (i.e. a physical MVP), submit some photos of the MVP being used.  In short, we will need to see the actual MVP and some of the results used in the pivot, rather than just a description of what you plan to implement.
