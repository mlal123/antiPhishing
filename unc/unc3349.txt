Ah, it is that time of year: the leaves are falling, basketball is starting
and you can't get into the computer science class that you want.

If you can't get into a course or onto the wait list (we are fixing those
that do not currently have wait lists), fill in this form
.  You should keep on checking for
availability in the course, but I will be reviewing class status throughout
the rest of the semester and see whether we can get you into the course.
