*Data Science Fellowship:*

Our next Data Science Fellowship has begun and the application is now open.
We=E2=80=99d really appreciate if you could spread the word to your student=
s
through posting or through a newsletter again. We really appreciate your
continued support!



*Program: *The Data Incubator is an intensive 8 week fellowship that
prepares Masters, PhDs, and postdocs in STEM + social science fields
seeking industry careers as data scientists. The program is free for
Fellows and supported by sponsorships from hundreds of employers across
multiple industries. In response to the overwhelming interest in our
earlier sessions, we will be holding another fellowship.

*Locations: *There will be both an in-person (in NYC, DC, SF) and online
section of the fellowship.

*Dates: *All sections will be from* 2016-09-06* to *2016-10-28*

*

*Who should apply: *Anyone within one year of graduating from a masters or
PhD program or who has already obtained a masters or PhD is welcome to
apply. Applications from international students are welcome. Everyone else
is encouraged to *sign up for a future session*

*Data Science in 30 minutes:* Learn how to build a data-science project in
our free Data Science in 30-minutes webcast
.  Signup soon
as space is limited.



*Zotero Trainer (Temp)*

I am writing to request assistance learning the online research program
known as Zotero.  I have a very basic familiarity with the program but need
some hands-on training.  Although I am a UNC graduate, I am no longer in
Chapel Hill, so the training would need to be online.  Compensation is $50
per hour.  If interested, please respond to this email and we can talk
further.  Thank you, David.  dhtyner@gmail.com
