From: Jay Smith (jaysmith) - jaysmith@email.unc.eduSo for your Luth=
er/Fisher reading for later in the week, think about these things (in addit=
ion to whatever else pops up in your mind):  1. If you had to finish=
 this sentence -- "The argument between Luther and Fisher was really a=
bout ______ " -- what would you say?  2. Do you think that Luth=
er's rhetoric was designed to heal the rift with Rome or to deepen it? Why =
did he open the pamphlet with an open letter to pope Leo X?  3. In w=
hat respect  did Luther insist in his "freedom"? How did he =
reconcile that defense of freedom with the proposition that "a Ch=
ristian is a dutiful servant subject to everyone"?  4. How=
 did Fisher's understanding of "authority" differ from Luther's?<=
