 the amount of time between points on the globe.  In such an environme=

was becoming outmoded as film and popular music came to dominate.  Thi=
s course examines the contemporary American
 novel in this context.  Should we understand the American novel as a =
"literature of exhaustion," to use the novelist's John Barth's te=

 reverse: has the novel's staying power allowed literature to dominate even=
 in a media-saturated present?  Our goal in answering all of these que=
stions will be to analyze changes to the novel form as highways and other t=
echnological developments altered the
 American cultural landscape.
