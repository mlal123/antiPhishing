Thanks for letting me know Mangza.  I know appointments are hard to come by right now, so please feel free to come in during drop-ins if you need help with anything. 
 Also, let me know if you can’t find a convenient appointment, and we may be able to work something out.

Hi Mrs. Graczyk I just wanted to apologize for missing my appointment. I've just had a really hectic week and was up late last night doing a comp assignment. I ended up sleeping in and not hear my
 alarm. I just wanted to apologize and didn't think I had just blown my appointment or you off. Sorry again!
