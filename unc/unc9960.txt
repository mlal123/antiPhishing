We are interviewing a potential instructor on Monday.  He will be giving a
lecture that covers 116 content on Monday at 11 am.  following the lecture,
we would like students who have attended the lecture to meet with him.  We
will provide lunch.  After meeting with him, I'll meet with those who were
at the lunch to get your feedback.  Please email me if you are interested
and available.

Thanks,
Diane
