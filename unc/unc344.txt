I'm sending this one out early because I will be at career fairs for the
next 2 days. I hope to see you all there!

I have the* final list of employers who will be attending both fairs *. 56
employers will be in attendance on Friday with the late addition of Apple
and PwC! I have attached the fair list since I know some of you have been
having a hard time viewing the jpegs when embedded in the email. Here are
the links to the employer lists for your convenience:
