			I hope you all have had an awesome past few days as National Champions! =
As part of the continued celebration, I want you all as members of the Enab=
ling Technology Club to be a part of the Best Buddies BBQ that's comin=
g up this Friday night (4/7) from=
 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM! As we mentioned in our last meeting, the BBQ is=
 hosted by Best Buddies, Pi Kapp, and Phi Mu, and will be held at the Pi Ka=
pp house (216 E Rosemary). All the event's proceeds will go to supporting B=
est Buddies, which is an organization that benefits people with disabilitie=
s through friendships. The Enabling Technology Club might also have a small=
 booth at the event describing our goals for Tar Heel Reader and Gameplay (=
and other projects) so that some of the student buddies can come check it o=
ut and see how we can help them.
		
			 
		
			We need your help! The BBQ needs several volunteers to work the event. T=
ickets are normally $5 in advance and $7 at the door, but if you come to volunteer, the Enabl=
ing Technology Club will pay for your ticket (free food)! We need you and would love =
to see you there! Please email me or sign up directly if you are interested=
. Here is the Google sheet link: the volunteer spots are designated either =
Pi Kapp or Phi Mu, but you can sign up whichever section you want to. You c=
ould even put a little note at the end of your name specifying you are with=
 us. For example, I would put "Evan Alpern (ETC)".<=
