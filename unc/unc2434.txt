Hey all,

My name is Benjamin Mustard but you can call me Ben. I am currently working
with Gary to get things organized for our work-study group. A few things
for you to know and do asap.

1) Bil has taken the liberty of setting up work emails for all of us on
google. If you have not worked here before, your google login will similar
to your onyen login.

Sign-in: onyen@cs.unc.edu
Password: Current onyen password

 If you are unable to log in, contact Bil Hays (hays@cs.unc.edu) and he can
take care of that for you. It is important that you log-in as soon as
possible for we will be doing the majority, if not all, of our work related
communications through our work emails and in-person meetings.

Raphael: You currently do not have an account, but I have e-mailed Bil on
your behalf to create it. Your work email should be up no later then
tomorrow, if not before.


2)    Gary would like for us to have a team meeting(s) this week, so it
would be expedient if you could send me your class schedules to my work
email (benpm@cs.unc.edu) so that I can arrange for our meeting(s) that best
fit our schedules. I will keep you updated and feel free to include any
important dates or events that are occurring this week for you as well.


3)    A google spreadsheet will be created for us to keep track of our time
for now. It is imperative that you keep careful track of your time and
ensure it is posted on said spreadsheet so payday can go smoothly.

I look forward to working with you all.

All the best,
Ben
