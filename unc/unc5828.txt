I would check with financial aid on that, I believe it  would but am not 100% sure. We do have funding opportunities available that could be an option as well.

Hello again, so I am covered with financial aid for my 4 years here at UNC and if I were to apply and be admitted for this program, the financial aid should just carry over there right? If it won't
 or if the financial aid isn't enough to cover all of it, what options do I have?

That should not be an issue. The requirement is that you complete ECON 125 and the application for the minor should go live in October.

Also, the eligibility for the Burch field Research requires that I be accepted into the E-minor program: by the time of the application (August 1st-September) I won't be in the
 E-minor program yet since I'll be taking Econ 125, will this pose an issue for when I apply for the Burch Field Research in Silicon Valley?

Hey, is the Silicon Valley trip only for honors Carolina students? or can anyone apply who's doing the E-minor?

Hi Mangza,


Thanks for the clarification! Econ 125 is required as a pre-req to the e-minor. 

 
I would recommend that you take it in the Fall of your junior year and then apply for the e-minor in the Spring of that year.

 
The Silicon Valley experience will allow you to receive credit for Econ 325, 327 and 393. In addition, you will complete your internship. Thus, in that semester
 you will be able to finish the e-minor program. 
 
Let me know if there is anything else you need.

Hi Mangza,

 
Thank you so much for reaching out! It was great to meet you last week.

 
Would you mind letting me know what year you are? That would help me ensure that I get you the best information.

 
Sorry I do not remember! I look forward to helping you as you consider the e-minor.

Hey Ms. Underwood, my name is Mangza, we met at 1789 last week at Carolina THINK. So I just had some few clarification questions I would like to ask. So since I have not taken Econ 125, I should
 not apply for the E-minor application this coming March? Also if I do the Silicon Valley study, which of my required courses would I be allowed to take there?  Thanks!
