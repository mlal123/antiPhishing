Hi Mangza -

I just wanted to confirm that you don't have any hours worked prior to 9/9,
which is the first time you used TIM.  I don't have any hours entered for
you into the Bishop Workstudy Team spreadsheet.  If you do have hours
before 9/9, please let me know ASAP so I can get them approved and logged
for you.

Thanks,

Beth
