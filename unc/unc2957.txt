From: Dylan Glotzer (dglotzer) - dglotzer@live.unc.eduHello all,  I would like to ask you to please take a mid-semester course evaluati=
on at  https://goo.gl/forms/krEFOEK7j5Xj1nA02  Your responses=
 will of course be anonymous, so please be honest. Taking the survey i=
s entirely optional, but it will give me a chance to get a better sense of =
where the class is as a whole, and help me to know of possible improve=
ments I can make to the class for the rest of the semester.  Best,  DG ----------------------This forwarded message was sent =
