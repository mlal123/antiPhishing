The Odum Institute Data Archive, along with partners=
 at Dryad, has been awarded a $184,45=
0 one-year grant from the Robert Wo=
od Johnson Foundation under the Foundation's Open-Access Research progr=
am. The project, "Increasing the Value of Open Access Through Open Data Publicat=
ion Policies," will seek to identify the most effective and=
 efficient methods for implementing robust data policies that incorporate d=
ata review and verification processes. Using an analysis of journal policies as well as survey and interviews of=
 journal editors, referees, and authors, the project will develop a model f=
or robust data policy implementation that includes recommendations on the c=
ontent and presentation of policies that support authors' understanding of =
policy expectations, frameworks for developing guidance documentation to en=
able authors to comply with the policy, and suggestions for manuscript revi=
ew workflow modifications that address the challenges of data policy implem=
entation.This evidence-based model wi=
ll provide clear and actionable guidance that may encourage journals to imp=
lement robust data policies that support the discoverability, accessibility=
, and usability of data underlying published articles.The project will be led by PIs Thu-Mai Christian, Odum Ins=
titute Assistant Director for Archives, and Professor Todd Vision, Associat=
e Professor of Biology and Adjunct Associate Professor in the School of Inf=

Short Course Spotlight: Cognitive Interviewing: A Hands-On ApproachNational Cancer Institute, National Inst=
itutes of HealthJoint Program in S=
urvey Methodology, University of Maryland/University of Michigan=
=20
 Cognitive interviewing has become a very popular me=
thod for pretesting and evaluating survey questionnaires. The current appro=
ach favored by Federal laboratories and private research institutions mainl=
y emphasizes the use of intensive verbal probes that are administered by sp=
ecially trained interviewers to volunteer respondents, often in a laborator=
y environment, to delve into the cognitive and socio-cultural processes ass=
ociated with answering survey questions.
=20
 Based on this information, the evaluator makes judg=
ments about where questions may produce difficulties in a number of subtle =
ways, due to cognitive demands they impose, cultural mismatches, or other s=
hortcomings. The short-course will cover the basic activities involved in a=
rranging a cognitive testing project, and will focus on the specifics of ho=
w to conduct verbal probing. Although an introduction to theory and backgro=
und perspective is included, the course will focus on the application and p=
ractice of cognitive interviewing techniques, as these are targeted toward =
both interviewer-administered (face-to-face or telephone) and self-administ=
ered (paper and web/internet) surveys.=20
  Participants will practice the conduct of cognitiv=
e interviews across modes, and will evaluate their results by judging where=
 questions have failed, and what one might do to revise them. The course ai=
ms to provide a working familiarity with cognitive techniques, so that stud=
ents will be able to begin conducting cognitive interviews on their own.=20
 The Instructor: Gordon Willis is a questionnaire design and pretesting s=
pecialist with affiliations at the National Institutes of Health, the Unifo=
rmed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), and the University=
 of Maryland. Prior to that he was Senior Research Methodologist at Researc=
h Triangle Institute, and he also worked for over a decade at the National =
Center for Health Statistics, CDC, to develop methods for developing and te=
sting survey questions. Willis attended Oberlin College, and received a PhD=
 in Cognitive Psychology from Northwestern University. He now works mainly =
in the area of the development and evaluation of surveys on cancer risk fac=
tors, and focuses on questionnaire pretesting. He has produced the "Qu=
estionnaire Appraisal System" for use in evaluating draft survey quest=
ions, and has written the book "Cognitive Interviewing: A Tool for Imp=
roving Questionnaire Design." His research interests include cross-cul=
tural issues in self-report surveys and research studies, and in particular=
 the development of best practices for questionnaire translation, and the d=
evelopment of pretesting techniques to evaluate the cross-cultural comparab=
ility of survey questions.=20
