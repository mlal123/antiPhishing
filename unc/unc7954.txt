The biggest unknowns in media in 2018

BY JAMES WARREN =B7 JA=
NUARY 2, 2018

 

Will the media's race for clickbait subside, the Facebook-Goo=
gle ad Goliath be slowed? And which consumers will pay for content?<=
/b>

New Year's Day brought loads of dishes, the engrossing college f=
ootball semi-finals (what a Georgia-Oklahoma game), NFL coach firings, Whit=
e House reporters cooling their heels
 in a Palm Beach IHOP as President Trump played golf =97 and the final=
 remnants of a holiday media staple: top 10 lists.
 
But wait. What about asking smart media folks what they don't know&=
nbsp;about what beckons in 2018? Yes, what about opening the year with =
a search for modesty not always associated with the press? So let's tr=
ack down a diverse group of smarties and ask what
 they'd love to ask a crystal ball =97 and maybe run to Las Vegas with the =
knowledge.

Hamilton Nolan, senior writer at Splint=
er and former Gawker stalwart: "I'd
 like to know how we're all going to keep having jobs while Google and Face=
book are taking all the ad money."

Mike Allen, Axios co-founder: "Wil=
l social platforms truly reward =97 with real
 monetization =97 publishers who produce first-class, worthy content withou=
t trashy, clunky web pages, annoying pop-up ads and hidden trackers that sl=
ow load times?=94

Jon Steinberg, founder of Cheddar: &quo=
t;When I started Cheddar I never could have
 foreseen the acceleration of amazing OTT (over the top) platforms like Sli=
ng, DirecTV Now, Philo, Fubo, YouTube TV, Sony Vue, etc. I wonder where we =
will be in a year. How old will the incumbent cable news audiences get? Whi=
ch bundles will replace traditional
 MVPDs (multichannel video programming distributors)? Which post cable=
 networks will take share from incumbents? What will TV in 2018 be?&qu=
ot;

Cenk Uygur, founder of The Young Turks:=
 "1. How well will the skinny bundles
 monetize? How many subscribers can they bring in? What percentage of inven=
tory will be filled? What will be the CPMs? What will 'ratings' look l=
ike? How well will standalone channels do on platforms like Amazon?"

"2. Can any digital media company survive on programmatic a=
nd branded advertising alone? A corollary to this question is whether adver=
tisers will ever figure out where their
 under-35-year-old customers went (hint: It's not television)?"=


Lowell Peterson, executive director of =
the Writers Guild of America, East:
 "Will the sexual harassment scandal finally move the entertainment in=
dustry past hand-wringing and focus groups on the issue of diversity toward=
 something that will actually make a difference =97 that is, meaningful pro=
gress on diverse hiring and diverse storytelling?
 An industry that does not reflect the diversity of our culture, and that c=
onsequently permits radical imbalance in representation and power, is not s=
ustainable in the long run."

Howard Tullman, serial entrepreneur and=
 CEO of the leading Chicago startup
 hub, 1871: "How soon will regular businesses benefit by the implement=
ation of the blockchain technologies which will eliminate millions of man-h=
ours of wasted time and redundant activities? Using smart contracts, JP Mor=
gan eliminated 360,000 hours of useless
 lawyer time reviewing standard contracts already."

Kathy Kiely, former longtime Washington=
 reporter-editor now teaching journalism
 at the University of New Hampshire: "Will news organizations end the =
self-destructive race for clickbait and take a chance on giving members of =
the public what they need to know, instead of a steady diet of what they wa=
nt to know? (Do we dare write about issues
 instead of Trump's latest tweet?)"

"As a corollary, will the public begin to understand that f=
inding the culprit for everything that they hate about the media is as simp=
le as looking in the mirror? Chartbeat
 tells us all we'd rather not know about your viewing and reading habits. I=
f you want better movies, TV shows, stories, you're going to have to vote w=
ith your clicks. That means changing habits."

She also wants to know, "Will the major institutions of civ=
il society =97 political, media, educational =97 undertake the massive publ=
ic health campaign it's going to take to get
 all of us to improve our media diets? What we did with tobacco, we're goin=
g to have to do with fake news and other media junk food: Identify the thre=
at it poses (in this case to the body politic, not the body), enlighten peo=
ple about how to make healthier
 choices and help people who are already addicted. As with tobacco, it will=
 take longer than a year to break the addiction, but will we start the effo=
rt?"

Jon Margolis, retired (to Vermont) form=
er chief political writer for the Chicago
 Tribune: "I would like to know: Will reporters figure out that they s=
hould stop tweeting? Of at least tweet a lot less. Reporting and writing a =
story is a day=92s work. It is not necessary (and often gets one in trouble=
) to waste time and energy venting one=92s
 spleen about whatever."

Clay Shirky, an Internet expert at New =
York University, wants to know about
 user-supported media: "2018 is a perfect test-case for user-supported=
 media. By the end of the year, we'll know if we passed or failed that test=
."

"It's a very big question. Ad-supported media long reigned.=
 Now, newspapers are about to begin their 49th consecutive quarter of year-=
on-year revenue declines." Their attempts
 have failed in essentially saying, "Just like paying for shoes you li=
ke, you must pay for news," conceptualizing it all as a sales transact=
ion, he says.

"NPR has the right model. People do not regard news as a pr=
oduct, and 'pay or else' does not motivate enough of them to subscribe. The=
 message that does work is 'You need us,
 and if you don't pitch in, we will go away.' The mindset of the media =
;subscriber is not 'I must pay for what I consume,' but 'God forbid there n=
ot be a New York Times.' "

"There is clearly no ad-supported alternative for most repo=
rting, and especially local reporting. The obvious alternative is to find a=
 small group of committed citizens in those
 cities and towns, enough to support the investigative journalism we need.&=
quot;

"Most of what's in a paper has more than adequate substitut=
es online, from display ads and sports pages to the horoscope and classifie=
ds. The one irreplaceable function =97 actual
 journalism =97 has to be supported by the people who need it. 2018 will te=
ll us if there are enough people who care enough to keep that journalism al=
