Hi all -

Please log into TIM and approve your timecard today *for the previous pay
period* that ended yesterday, 11/27.  Open your time card and select *previous
pay period* from the drop down at the top right of the tab with your
timecard on it.  Then if everything looks good to you, you can click
on "approve
timecard" and then "approve".  You have until 5 pm today to approve your
timecard.

Since we are in the new version of TIM now, things look a little different
but function essentially the same.  Please see a screen shot below with the
"previous pay period" and approval buttons circled - your screen will be a
little different than this, but this gives you an idea of what to look for.

*Select Previous Pay Period FIRST*
then after that, you may select Approve Timecard if everything looks OK

As always, if you have any questions please let me know!

Thanks,

Beth
