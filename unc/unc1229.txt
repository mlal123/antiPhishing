From: Jay Smith (jaysmith) - jaysmith@email.unc.eduGreetings from icy north Chapel Hill:  Because of the many disruptions of the past few days, I'm going to reschedule the quiz that is currently scheduled for tomorrow. I'm tentatively planning to give you the quiz on Wednesday. It will be a short, ten-question, multiple-choice quiz on lecture material (mostly) and the Utopia reading. The More material would only aim to make sure you've read the text--not memorized any of it, so you can relax on that score.  We shall see what tomorrow brings..... ----------------------This forwarded message was sent via Sakai @ UNC-Chapel Hill Messages from the  "HIST158.001.SP16" site.
