gradx.io is connecting university students with the top companies in
financial services and high-growth technology companies like BlackRock, S&P
Global, Airbnb, Evernote, and more. We are looking for CS students
graduating in 2017, 2018, and 2019 for internships, projects, and full time
roles beginning in the spring of 2017. All majors are accepted and GPA is
not a deciding factor for any consideration. Please send your resumes to
emily@gradx.io and complete this brief assessment
 and you will hear from us within 24 hours.
