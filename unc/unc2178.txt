From: Logan Tatham (ltatham) - ltatham@live.unc.eduHello class,  One student reminded me of a WebAssign assignment I forgot to mention in class. There is a L'hospital's rule review assignment due tonight, but it is not mandatory. It's worth 0 points and is an optional review/way to check that WebAssign is working properly.  Also, I realized that the syllabus I sent out had a mistake in it. There are no pop quizzes in class or recitations on Fridays. I've put an updated syllabus on Sakai.
