From: Megan Eagen (galileo) - galileo@email.unc.eduDear Class, =
 I wanted to share that I created a concise study guide to go along with=
 the playlist for Unit II. You will find this in the Sakai --> Resources=
 folder, "Unit II Study Materials." The Unit II exam is scheduled=
 for next Tuesday.*  Although we did not get through the last few se=
ctions of chapter 7, please do complete the reading and quiz online (due by=
 11:55pm). The chapter 8 quiz is optional but recommended, given the upcomi=
ng test.  Best,  Dr. E-J     *Folks who wi=
ll take the exam through ARS: please be sure to get this scheduled. You wil=
l need to arrange with myself or one of the TAs to complete the listening p=
ortion. ----------------------This forwarded message was sent vi=
