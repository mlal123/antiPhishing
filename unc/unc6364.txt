Hello Morrison,

I hope this message finds you well on this beautiful Monday. I wanted to re=
ach out and put a few things on your radar:

Andy's Last Day
Friday will be my last day as the Morrison Community Director, as I transit=
ion into a new role outside of UNC. Having served as CD for the past three =
years and two months, it has been an enormous pleasure to serve in this pos=
ition and one that I will remember fondly. Although the year has just start=
ed, it was a pleasure to meet those of you that I had the fortune of spendi=
ng time with. Whether this is your first semester in Morrison or your 5th, =
I truly appreciate you choosing this place to call home.

What does this mean for you all? Fortunately, very little will change. Your=
 RA's will still be great, the OA's will still have great front desk playli=
sts, and the only change will be who you sends you e-mails. After I leave, =
you will receive information about who to contact during the transition wit=
h issues regarding Morrison. Your RA and OA staff are still a great place f=
or questions, as they will make sure that the information gets to the appro=
priate people.

Donuts!
To commemorate this occasion, I'm going out with Donuts. Thursday morning f=
rom approximately 8:00am until supplies last I'll have donuts in the lobby =
for early risers (or folks who have yet to go to bed) to enjoy on your way =
to and from class.

Disclaimer: You are allowed, and encouraged, to get a donut whether or not =
you know who I am.

Scantrons coming at 8pm
We got a fresh shipment of Scantrons coming in tonight by 8pm. I'm buying i=
n bulk, so hopefully it will last a little longer! My apologies for folks w=
ho came down to a bare cupboard.

Thanks for everything, Morrison. This was my first job out of graduate scho=
ol and I couldn't have asked for a better experience with better students. =
In my next chapter I will be working as an Academic Advisor at Virginia Com=
monwealth University, and I hope to always make 445 Paul Hardin Dr. proud.

Please let me know how I can support you over the next few days, and be wel=
l!
