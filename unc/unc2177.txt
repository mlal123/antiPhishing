Thanks for reminding me of this. No, it is not, it is an optional practice to make sure WebAssign works properly. I'll send an email to the class letting them know.


Thanks!

Hello,
I just wanted to send you all a quick message welcoming you to the class! My name is Logan, I'm a Ph.D. student studying math and I'm excited to teach this course. Calculus 2 was my favorite course at the time (I've since taken cooler math courses) and I
 hope you can catch some of my enthusiasm for the material!
I've posted the syllabus earlier this morning, and have attached it to this email. Please look over it sometime before coming to class on Monday. In it are instructions on how to use WebAssign. Homeworks will be due starting on Tuesday, so it is important
 that you get WebAssign working as soon as possible.
Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Logan
