We are working to launch delivery of TRU products to specific campus

location-based, real-time mobile app that can facilitate customers to order
with TRU based on proximity to a delivery checkpoint and estimated delivery
time (sort of like finding an Uber).

his job and owning TRU keeps him too busy to develop the app himself.
However, he will be minimally involved for any input on the project. This
