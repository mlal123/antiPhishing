Hello UNC PhD students!



Ever wonder what PhDs really work on at Google? Do they conduct research?
What Google products do PhDs work on? Does Google have a need for my highly
specialized area? Well look no further: we are here to answer your
questions.



Starting on October 4, we=E2=80=99re presenting a series of live-streamed Y=
ouTube
sessions to pull back the curtain on what it=E2=80=99s really like to be a =
PhD
software engineer at Google. These sessions are for students interested in
knowing more about all walks of life as a PhD Googler: the intersection
between research and products, machine learning systems operating at Google
scale, working at the bleeding edge of privacy and security, and more.
These sessions will be live on YouTube, but since the recordings won=E2=80=
=99t be
posted immediately after the event you=E2=80=99ll have to tune in as they h=
