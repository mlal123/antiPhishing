Hi STEM colleagues!

I wanted to reach out to you and ask if you would be willing to
circulate/advertise the attached Summer Biomedical Engineering courses to
your UG students. If you have any courses you would like me to advertise to
our students, please let me know!

"
*Chemists*: BMME 150 (Material science), BMME 201 (Matlab for Engineers),
BMME 580: Microcontroller Applications 1 (pairs nicely with analytical
chemistry instrumentation)

*Physicists*: BMME 580=E2=80=94Microcontroller applications (may be useful =
for
advanced lab); BMME 465=E2=80=94Biomedical Instrumentation (nice applicatio=
n of
electronics/preparation for advanced lab)

*Computer Scientists:* BMME 355: Electronics, BMME 465: Instrumentation,
BMME 580: Microcontroller applications (All good courses as pre-requisites
for robotics, etc.)

*Mathematicians:* BMME 350: electronics, BMME 580: Microcontroller
applications, and BMME 465: Biomedical Instrumentation =E2=80=93 all potent=
ially
useful for applied mathematics.

*For NON-BME Students, we are willing to waive pre-requisites with
instructor permission!*

Please see attached course descriptions. If you have any questions, please
feel free to contact the BME Summer School administrator: Devin Hubbard (
devin@unc.edu)! We hope to see some of you in your courses!
