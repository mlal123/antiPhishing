Hi I hope all is well,
 
My name is Mangza Lal and I am working this summer as an RA in Graham. I am unable to log into unc tim for my time log and I was wondering what steps I need to take to resolve this issue? I have tried my onyen and
 password but those don't seem to be working. My pid is 730006540 and onyen is mlal123.
 
Thanks,
 
Mangza
