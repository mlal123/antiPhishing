Oct 13th | 5:30-7pm | 011 Sitterson Hall
*Speaker: Sheldon Fernandez, VP of Engineering & CTO of Personif*
In the last couple years, a revolution in Artificial Intelligence has
captured the public imagination. We're entering the era of Deep Learning, a
terrifyingly powerful and intimidating set of technologies. Using
sophisticated neural
networks, these systems have started to achieve the remarkable: describe
the content of images in English words, play GO (the ancient board game
from the Far East), at the championship level, and understand natural
language
with the sophistication of a human interlocutor. The implications are
profound =E2=80=93 and alarming. Like all frightening technology revolution=
s,
however, empowerment comes from understanding. This talk is
about making Deep Learning understandable enough to not fear.

*Tech Consultant | For UNC Professor*

I am a retired Psychology Prof with an innovative idea that promotes active
learning for online instruction.  I want to embed fill-blank questions
scattered through the lesson that students would answer in sequence (and
get immediate feedback for) as they go through the material (text, images,
audio/video).  Student entries would be preserved in a database.



I would like to create a Wordpress "generic module" as a template to be
used in implementing the idea.  As a retired prof I have full UNC access
and use web.unc.edu for web development.  I believe the =E2=80=9Cconditiona=
l logic=E2=80=9D
option in the Gravity Forms plugin for Wordpress would be a useful tool,
and UNC has provided access to this plugin.  I have hit a roadblock,
however, in trying out my idea with Gravity Forms, and I hope a
knowledgeable Wordpress buff could guide me in getting the project going.
I suppose a one-hour meeting on or near campus would help us figure it
out.  It probably only requires someone used to understanding
documentation.  I=E2=80=99d put $20 toward that session.  If we need more
time/contacts after that, I=E2=80=99d be ready to pay for that too.

Please contact me any time at =E2=80=94 david_eckerman@unc.edu or 919-265-4=
188 (text
or call).  I=E2=80=99m ready to get this solved.
