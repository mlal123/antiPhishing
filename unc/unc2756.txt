Good morning everyone!

I hope you all recovered from Career Week and are now hearing back from
some employers that you connected with at the Tech Fair last Friday. It was
a great event, we had a great turnout, and I received many compliments
about you from the recruiters in attendance. Thank you to all that attended
and for representing yourself and the UNC brand so well!

*Important Announcements:*

   - It has come to my attention that many students are not updating their
   careerolina profile which can be problematic when you are trying to appl=
y
   for things with strict requirements (ex. on-campus interviews and mock
   interviews, and job/internship postings). Make sure that you have your
   personal profile up to date paying special attention to the *major* you
   have listed, your *current cumulative GPA, *and *intended graduation
   date* as these are often times the things that can get you in trouble if
   not accurate. Log into Careerolina
   and click
on the *User
   Profile* tab to the left to view and edit your information. If your
   profile is not accurate, you can be blocked from applying for things and=
 I
   don't want that to happen!
   - We have started noticing a large discrepancy in the number of students
   who RSVP for events and those that show up (Company evening sessions, CS
   symposium, for example). This is *very problematic* for several reasons
   which most of you understand and have been very respectful. I want to po=
int
   out that it is *NOT appropriate* or professional to RSVP for something
   and then not show up. We understand that things happen but
   the discrepancy is large and employers are noticing when I tell them 50
   students will come and only 20 show up. This reflects poorly on our
   students, our department and the institution. PLEASE, if you are coming
   to an event or session that requires an RSVP,  use the RSVP system put i=
n
   place (links are always included on the calendar and in my emails). If y=
ou
   are not certain you can make it, please hold off on RSVP'ing until you c=
an
   look at your calendar and commit to that event. This is a practice we
   need to get in the habit of as its a common courtesy that will serve you
   well in your professional life.

*Graduate Student Contract | Office of Research in the Department of Allied
Health Sciences, Chapel Hill NC  *This UNC Department is looking to hire a
graduate student on a contract basis who has enough experience to help with
some SharePoint 2013 programming. The student must understand Custom Work
Flows, be able to do Web Parts, and have experience with InfoPath.
Specifically, the student must have experience with InfoPath form
development and integration with SharePoint, be able to create and
troubleshoot the SharePoint custom workflow created by others, WebPart
programming, and approval management. The version of SharePoint 2013 and
InfoPath 2013 that we are working with is Office 365. If interested, you

*Tech Consultant | For UNC Professor*

I am a retired Psychology Prof with an innovative idea that promotes active
learning for online instruction.  I want to embed fill-blank questions
scattered through the lesson that students would answer in sequence (and
get immediate feedback for) as they go through the material (text, images,
audio/video).  Student entries would be preserved in a database.



I would like to create a Wordpress "generic module" as a template to be
used in implementing the idea.  As a retired prof I have full UNC access
and use web.unc.edu for web development.  I believe the =E2=80=9Cconditiona=
l logic=E2=80=9D
option in the Gravity Forms plugin for Wordpress would be a useful tool,
and UNC has provided access to this plugin.  I have hit a roadblock,
however, in trying out my idea with Gravity Forms, and I hope a
knowledgeable Wordpress buff could guide me in getting the project going.
I suppose a one-hour meeting on or near campus would help us figure it
out.  It probably only requires someone used to understanding
documentation.  I=E2=80=99d put $20 toward that session.  If we need more
time/contacts after that, I=E2=80=99d be ready to pay for that too.

Please contact me any time at =E2=80=94 david_eckerman@unc.edu or 919-265-4=
188
(text or call).  I=E2=80=99m ready to get this solved.
