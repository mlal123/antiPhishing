Good evening,








I hope this email finds you well and enjoying th=
e beginning of Summer break.  I spoke with the Comp =
;Sci department about an
opportunity and I'm emailing to give you some informat=
ion and see if anyone is interested.



My name is Julia=
n and I am leading the development of a venture that produces an app/compan=
ion website which use GPS/location based technology to connect people =
by allowing them to broadcast events they create
 on a map. Surrounding users are able to see the event and participate. Add=
itional functionality includes the ability to create profiles, send me=
ssages, and coordinate registration. Also we are developing a facial recogn=
ition component. This technology is focused
 on three primary areas: Greek (frat/sorority) life, fitness, and live musi=
c events. I explain the appeal for each group below. Think of this technolo=
gy as the Uber of fitness and socializing.


Greek Life: The app/website streamlines communicating with=
 members in a chapter/between Greek organizations, creating private events =
for rush/socializing, advertising philanthropic events, collecting dues, co=
ordinating large events like Alumni
 Weekend/Homecoming/etc. 

Fitness: Often a person would like to go to the gym or wor=
k towards improving their physical fitness but they don't for a range of re=
asons. The technology helps connect you to others that are also lookin=
g for fitness support (gym buddy). Additional
 functionality allows already active people to broadcast events that you cr=
eate such as pick up games of basketball, etc and others can join.


Live Events: Want to see live music or find a specific typ=
e of food truck? Well this technology can help with that. Music venues are =
able to list who is playing and type of music that people can search. Also =
you can use the GPS feature to find
 your favorite food truck. 


As
 we prepare for launch in the Fall, I'm looking for a couple members to joi=
n our tech team (also UNC students, so it's a fun team). Currently we have =
the code for iOs version of the app which needs a little tweaking. There is=
 a forceload version of Android
 so there are development opportunities there as well. The website is compl=
ete and we are just polishing with infographics, etc,  We have secured=
 some huge partnerships with UNC, and this is your chance to be a part of t=
he creation and launch of technology
 that will change how people connect.


I was fortunate =
to have gotten my start in
entrepreneurship at Carolina (and NCSSM) and to have used that start to lea=
d ventures to success (e.g. Nominated for
 2012 White House Champions for Change Award, Inducted into UNC's Order of =
the Golden Fleece, Awarded the 2013 Emerging Issues Prize for Innovation, A=
warded 2013 Triangle Business Journal Top 40 Under 40 Entrepreneur award, e=
tc).
Also this venture advanced all the way to the =
Finals of the Carolina Challenge this year.



If you are inter=
ested (doesn't matter if you're not here over the summer), please email me =
at julian_wooten@med.unc.edu AND julian.wooten@gmail.com (I get a lot of em=
ails so I want to be sure that I receive
 it). 


I look forward t=
o hearing from you and potentially working together.
