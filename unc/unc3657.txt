At Google, we believe information should be universally accessible.  Our
education and scholarship programs aim to inspire and help students become
future leaders in computing and technology by breaking down the barriers
that prevent them from entering these fields.  If selected, scholarship
recipients will each receive a $10,000 scholarship for the 2017-2018
academic year and be invited to attend the annual Google Scholars' Retreat
at the Googleplex next summer.
