Hello,

My name is Kaitlyn Yakaboski and I am the campus representative for the For=

ortunity for women at UNC to distinguish themselves on their resume, as wel=

 It includes a curriculum to work through, including modules focused career=
 exploration, personal branding, and more, as well as rewards along the way=
 (inclusion in the Forte Resume book, introductory email to the sponsor com=
pany of your choice, resume review by JP Morgan, etc.). I've attached a fly=

Would you be willing to share this flyer, as well as the short blurb above =

Thank you,
