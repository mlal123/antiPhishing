Hey yall,


Couple quick things before the tournament tomorrow.


First of all, great job signing up for all the slots on the document.  If y=
ou are playing in the tournament, we need you filling in as runners while y=
ou are not playing.  3 is the absolute minimum that should be runners at an=
y one time.  Purshotam and Matt Angerson will be running the board this wee=
kend.  Be ready for them to have you find people and send them to their cou=
rts.  Huge part of the success of this tournament revolves around us gettin=
g the losers of matches to ref the next match and getting people to their c=
ourts quickly.  The signup document is at the end of the email.


As mentioned above, losers ref the next matches.  When the ref of a match b=
rings a scorecard back, it is crucial that the a runner is given the next s=
core card and you, as the runner, goes to the court that just opened up and=
 grab the loser to ref before they walk away.  Then you go and find the nex=
t players and get them there too.


If you are playing in the tournament remember to bring some food to share w=
ith the players.  Homemade is best cuz it shows effort and tastes better, b=
ut no worries if not.  Also remember that we have to keep the participants =
happy to be certain they come back next year-- so make sure we all eat last=
, in case we didn't get enough food for everyone.


Finally, because we have refs at this tournament, here are the most common =
types of avoidables.  Player 1 is the person hitting the ball, player 2 is =
the opponent:


1) Player 1 is fully set up for the ball, and player 2 is blocking either t=
he cross court pass (the shot that will dump the ball in the opposite, back=
 corner of the court) or the shot straight to the front wall.  This is an a=
voidable even if Player 1 takes the shot.

2) Player 1 is fully set up for the ball and hits player 2 on the backswing=
, before hitting the ball (unless the baskswing is considered "excessive" b=
y the ref)

3) Player 1 is fully set up for the ball and would (or does) hit player 2 o=
n the forward swing.  Normally they should hold up in this case, but either=
 way it is an avoidable.

4) Player 1, which in this case is you reading the email, should text me wi=
th the word avoidable so I know how many actually read my emails.

5) Player 2 steps into the shot of Player 1 for no good reason, when the sh=
ot had previously been cleared.


Let me know if you have any questions before tomorrow!
