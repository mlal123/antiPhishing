We=E2=80=99ve recently had some incidents with persons unaffiliated with th=
e
university being in the building after hours by themselves.

Please remember to never let anyone into the building after hours.  If they
don=E2=80=99t have their own access card they don=E2=80=99t belong in the b=
uilding.

When you enter or leave the building and the doors are locked, if there are
persons waiting by the doors, please do not let them in.  Even if they look
like students (the persons who were in the building looked like students).
If you feel uncomfortable confronting such persons consider
leaving/entering by some other door.

And, of course, never prop open an outside door!

We love the sense of community that access to the building fosters, but
safety has to be our first concern. Access cards are a privilege, not a
right, and abuse of the privilege is cause for forfeiture.

With the semester coming to an end and projects due, we see more students
working late on the building.  When you are working late, please be smart
and be safe!
