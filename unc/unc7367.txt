CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

The 2018 ITSEW will be held June 4-6 in Durham, North Carolina, hosted by the Duke Initiative on Survey Methodology and the Odum Institute for
Research in Social Science at the University of North Carolina. The workshop will feature a keynote address by Dr. Roger Tourangeau, Vice President at
Westat and past president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR).
ITSEW is aimed at statisticians, survey managers and methodologists, pollsters, public opinion researchers, and marketing research professionals
focused on survey quality and the challenges of combined data products. Through presentations and exchange of information the workshop aims to support
a better understanding of total survey error.
The theme of the 2018 workshop is “Approaches for Mitigating Total Survey Error (TSE) and Its Effects.” 
We welcome submission on any topic related to total survey error, but especially encourage contributions such as:
• Methods for combining and analyzing data from multiple sources
• Adaptive design and data collection strategies
• Approaches for minimizing TSE when using non-probability samples
• Uses of administrative data to reduce TSE
However, any and all topics related to TSE are welcome. If you would like to present research at the workshop, please submit an abstract by February
16, 2018 (max. 400 words).
Presentations on research still in progress are highly encouraged. Be prepared to share a (preliminary) paper prior to the workshop so that attendees
can prepare for discussion. Applicants will be notified of the acceptance of their abstracts by mid-March.
For any questions, please email dism@duke.edu ( mailto:dism@duke.edu ).

ResearchTalk Data Integration in Mixed Methods and Qualitative Studies (

If you will conduct more than one qualitative or mixed methods project in your career, the courses offered during ResearchTalk's (

) December Data Integration in Mixed Methods and Qualitative Studies event should be required.
 Here is a major takeaway principle from each course:
Analytic Transitions: Integration and Bridging in Qualitative Analysis
 Instructors: Ray Maietta and Paul Mihas
 Date: December 6, 2017
 Resist the temptation to simply code and categorize text as a passive activity that divorces text from context. Instead use dynamic analysis tools,
like memoing and diagramming, that foster a focus on the integration of key ideas throughout the life of your project.
Exploring the “Mix” in Mixed Methods Research: Meeting the Challenges of Data Integration
 Instructor: Margarete Sandelowski
 Date: December 4-5, 2017
 Points of integration between your qualitative and quantitative data should be directive to your mixed methods work. Instead of focusing on the
quantitative data and then stopping to work on the qualitative (and vice versa), consider letting the ‘mix’ that emerges from a project defined by
both types of data direct project decision-making and data engagement.
To truly understand processes of daily life, we need to be responsible to how component parts of our evolving analysis integrate, not just how they
stand alone.
Come to Carrboro, North Carolina to reset your methods approach.
