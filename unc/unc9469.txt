we are looking for students interested in being a learning assistant in the
fall.

The Fall 2018 COMP 401 LA experience will be offered as a 10-hour per week
practicum associated with enrollment in COMP 227, Effective Peer-Teaching
In Computer Science, a 3-credit elective that carries an EE tag. This means
that COMP 401 LAs will receive graded credit instead of monetary
compensation for their participation as an LA. COMP 227 course material
will cover advances in how computer science is taught, active learning
techniques, goal motivation theory and other topics of interest in the
field of computer science education. Fall 2018 COMP 401 LAs will also be
preferentially considered for paid Spring 2018 COMP 401 positions. If you
are interested in serving as a Fall 2018 COMP 401 LA as part of taking COMP
227, please fill out the 401 LA form


If you are interested in a paid position for another course (not 110 or
101), please fill out the LA interest form
.  For these positions, individual
faculty will be contacting you about possible interest but final decisions
cannot be made until the fall when registration numbers and instructional
budgets are more concrete.

If you are interested in LAing fo 110 or 101, I'm afraid that you've missed
the deadline.  For future reference, information about the process is at
http://comp110.com/become-a-uta/
