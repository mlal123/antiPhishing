I am searching for a full stack mobile application developer (iOS /Android)
to join our team for a new venture. We are willing to discuss the specifics
of the opportunity with any students who may be interested. Please have
them reach out to me directly at jhrtennis@icloud.com or text/call my cell

team.



*App Developer: *

The application is a Math App which is designed to strengthen the intuitive
and analytical abilities of students through unique and interactive
activities. Currently I need:

1. A demo to be completed to show schools
2. The actual app itself to be developed.
I am extremely interested to have the app developed by students at UNC
rather than any other institution and or corporation. If that is something
that can be done, then of course I would love to know the cost and the
timetable to get it all completed. I have been award the money to get this
project off the ground. Now I am looking for the right people behind me to
help make it happen.
Contact Charise Lesane at charise.lesane@icloud.com if interested.
