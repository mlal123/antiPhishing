Hi Mangza -

We are paid every other Friday - when you sign off doesn't affect when you
get your pay for that pay period.  Today is not a payday - next Friday,
11/11 is for the week of Oct 17 - Oct 30 which is the pay period that we
just closed on Sunday.  So you'll get paid for that next week.  Please let
me know if you have any questions!

Thanks,
