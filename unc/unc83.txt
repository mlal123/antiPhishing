The On-Campus Experience

Housing: Living on campus means more than just having a roof over your
head. Living on campus transforms lives by bringing people together,
fostering friendships, creating leaders, and providing paths for lifelong
development and academic excellence.

Dining: Both Lenoir and Rams Head Dining Halls are conviniently located in
close proximity to our residence halls, not to mention all the other
options on campus: Wendy's, Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, Medditeranean Deli...
the list goes on. Carolina Dining Services also educates students on
healthy lifestyle choices and hosts all kinds of special events throughout
the year.

Campus Rec: The Rams Head Recreation Center and the Student Recreation
Center are also conveniently located next door to our residence halls.
Additionally, Campus Rec is home to all sports clubs on campus, intramural
sports teams, aquatic facilities, climbing walls, and all sorts of fun
fitness classes.

Carolina Union: More than a building, the Union offers a variety of spaces
for students to relax, refresh, chat with friends, or study. The Union also
provides many services for the University community by supporting and
enhancing student organizations and the programs they create.

Move-In Guide

You should have received a Move-In Guide at orientation, but if you have
misplaced your copy - don't worry! Download it off of our website by
clicking [7]here.  Additionally, the parking pass that you will need to
bring with you on move-in day is on our website. Download it [8]here.
The Move-In Guide has everything you need to know about Move-In Weekend,
including: important dates, common questions, what comes in a room, items
to bring or leave at home, a map, check-in instructions, and other
beneficial information, so make sure you have it on hand!

Move-In Date & Time

Also in your Move-In Guide, you will find your move-in date and time:
* DAY: If you are assigned to Craige, Craige North, Ehringhaus, Koury,
Hardin, Hinton James, Horton, or Morrison, and your room number ends in an
ODD number, your move-in day is Friday, August 14. If you are assigned to
one of these halls and your room number ends in an EVEN number, your
move-in day Saturday, August 15. All other halls, regardless of room
number, have a move-in day of Saturday, August 15.
* TIME: If the first letter of your last name is between A-G, your time
is 10:30 a.m.; H-M, your time is 12:00 p.m.; N-S, your time is 1:30 p.m.;
T-Z, your time is 9:00 a.m.

Bed Lofting 101

Lofting those residence hall beds can be tricky, so we had some of our
student staff put together a video that shows you exactly how to make it
happen! Check it out [9]here.

Check Out Our Blog

Our blog is written for students, by students. Here's a snippet of the
"(Week of) Welcome to UNC!" post:

Tech Specs

All residence hall rooms and apartments are equipped with free digital
cable television, however, customers need an HDTV with a QAM-capable tuner
to view all of the digital and HD channels (which the majority of TVs
already have, but not all). Not sure what a QAM tuner is? When you go to
purchase a TV, ask a sales rep to help - the information should be listed
on the box. Alternatively, if you have a TV without a QAM tuner, you can
purchase a separate QAM tuner box. Read more about this topic [11]here.
