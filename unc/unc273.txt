We'll be having a second meeting Wednesday evening, intended for majors who
want more detail about programs and opportunities.  This is your chance to
learn details about our programs without needing to schedule an advising
appointment.  It also gives you the chance to hear other people's questions
that you may not have thought about.   So what's on the agenda?

We'll be recognizing the winners of the Dunham and Weiss awards (with a
guest appearance from Steve Weiss, our department chair for 15 years).

Jade Baricelli will be overviewing the Carolina to Careers Programs, give
you hints on using Careerolina to look for jobs/internships, and give you
inside advice on preparing for the upcoming Career Fairs.

We'll have an update on HackNC and how you can participate.

I'll cover a range of topics

   - report on curriculum policy and changes that are in the works (don't
   worry: nothing dramatic)
   - learning contracts
   - internships
   - how to get involved in research
   - becoming an undergrad TA
   - study abroad
   - honors theses
   - ways to meet Honors Program requirements
   - BS/MS program.


And of course, there will be a chance to mingle over light refreshments
when it's over.

See you on Wednesday!
