Thank you to everyone who participated in Pi Your Professor today!

It was so much fun, and we raised $702 to date for student clubs. Pics will
be on our Facebook page later today.

Thank you faculty members for being such good sports. For those of you who
threw pies back at the students, please contact me about your $100 donation
to the cause, and I'll adjust the total as those donations come in.

Thank you students, for being brave enough to throw pies at people who hold
your academic and future career success in their hands.

Thank you to the Admin and Facilities staff who helped with logistics and
set up, manned tables and helped clean up (and you, too, Jade). We couldn't
have done it without you.

See you next Pi Day!
