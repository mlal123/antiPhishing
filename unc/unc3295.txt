*JOIN YOUR FELLOW FACULTY AND STUDENTS ON NOVEMBER 4!*

* The IBM Research Triangle Park Center for Advanced Studies *



*(RTP CAS) and IBM North Carolina Technical Experts Council (NC TEC) invite
you to*
* IBM University Day*




* Friday, November 4th 8:30 AM - 12:30 PM at the IBM Employee Activity and
Fitness Center Building 400, Cornwallis Drive RTP, North Carolina*
Contact Andy Rindos (rindos@us.ibm.com) if you plan to attend.

The theme will be
*K-12 STEM Outreach by Our Local Universities*


* Speakers include local faculty and university leaders (and IBMers) who
will talk about their efforts to inspire young students in grades K-12
(especially women and under-represented minorities) to pursue careers in
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math)*






* Also in attendance (especially for students) will be representatives from
IBM Recruiting, IBM Academic Initiative and IBM Global University Programs
We are currently accepting submissions for poster presentation by students
and faculty (contact rindos@us.ibm.com )*


Please join your colleagues who will already be attending. All
faculty/educators and students are invited to participate in *IBM
University Day* on *Friday, November 4, (8:30 AM - 12:30 PM)* at the *IBM
Employee Activity and Fitness Center*in *RTP, NC*. Each year, RTP CAS
sponsors IBM University Day, as an opportunity to bring together the IBM NC
research/development/services and local/regional academic communities. One
goal is to allow the universities to inform the local IBM community of
ongoing projects, new developments and opportunities for collaboration
(highlighting skills and strengths, etc.) - and vice versa - hopefully
helping to launching new projects. Another goal is to bring future
employees (students) together with prospective employers (IBM managers and
recruiters) - with a student poster as one very effective approach in
advertising one's self. The event consists of three tracks: main hall
presentations, parallel back room sessions and meetings, and poster
sessions and tables/booths in the hallways.

This fall, the theme of *IBM University Day* will be "*K-12 STEM Outreach
by Our Local Faculty"*. Our Senior State Executive for NC and General
Manager of Global Business Services Global Operations, Fran O'Sullivan,
will preview some new IBM opportunities at the event. Our keynote
university speakers will be Glenn Kleiman, Executive Director of the NC
State Friday Institute and Duke Professor Nan Jokerst (Chair, Duke Academic
Council). The agenda also includes other local faculty and university
leaders (and IBMers) who will speak about their K-12 STEM outreach efforts
that includes: various Friday Institute initiatives on behalf of the NC
Department of Public Instruction; state-wide and local Alice training
programs, introducing young students to basic programming principles;
Extreme IT Day, inspiring high school students to pursue IT studies and
careers; Kenan Fellows Program efforts to expose K-12 teachers to
real-world high tech environments; outreach programs associated with our
NSF-sponsored centers; and more.

As in the past, it is open to all at IBM NC and our regional universities -
as well as local elementary, middle and high schools. We especially hope
that participants will make a special effort to invite their K-12 partners
to the event. And we also strongly encourage all attendees to bring their
children to this IBM University Day.

Backroom workshops and tables/booths will be sponsored by several important
IBM university relations programs.*IBM recruiters* will be present to speak
with students. Representatives from the*IBM Academic Initiative*will also
be available to discuss its many program benefits, including the
availability of most of the IBM software catalogue for use in teaching and
research, absolutely free. And representatives from *IBM Global University
Programs*(which funds university collaborations through programs like the
IBM Shared University Research, Faculty Awards and PhD Fellowship programs)
will also be there.

Therefore, please reserve the date, and encourage your fellow faculty and
students to attend. Feel free to forward this announcement to others in
your department, college or university (both faculty and students). And
please note that K-12 students and teachers are welcome!

The detailed agenda is immediately below. Directions are given at bottom.
Contact *Andy Rindos (rindos@us.ibm.com ) *with any
questions, as well as to submit a poster or register for the event.
