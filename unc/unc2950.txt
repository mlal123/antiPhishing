*Speaker: Sheldon Fernandez, VP of Engineering & CTO of Personif*
In the last couple years, a revolution in Artificial Intelligence has
captured the public imagination. We're entering the era of Deep Learning, a
terrifyingly powerful and intimidating set of technologies. Using
sophisticated neural
networks, these systems have started to achieve the remarkable: describe
the content of images in English words, play GO (the ancient board game
from the Far East), at the championship level, and understand natural
language
with the sophistication of a human interlocutor. The implications are
profound =E2=80=93 and alarming. Like all frightening technology revolution=
s,
however, empowerment comes from understanding. This talk is
about making Deep Learning understandable enough to not fear.
