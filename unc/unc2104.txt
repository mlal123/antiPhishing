If you are looking for a way to stand out in job interviews, you should
consider
improving your knowledge of the business fundamentals through UNC Business

Essentials. Take a minute and check out the video on this page to learn
about our
 online business training program: (bit.ly/1v9Ps1m)

Kenan-Flagler Business School designed UNC Business Essentials to help
non-
business majors acquire a solid foundation of the business basics without
having to
commit to earning a minor or major in business. As most professions
incorporate the
essential principles of business, the program's modules on marketing
channels,
budget management, economic drivers, operations, and communication skills
are
immediately applicable in the real world and will complement any major. 

Each of the six modules takes approximately 10-12 hours to finish so that
the entire
program can be completed this summer if you commit 4-5 hours a week to it.
Enroll
now and start the next academic year with a solid understanding of
business and
renewed confidence for interviews.

Please give me a call or email me if you'd like to discuss UNC Business
Essentials or
this $500 limited time  tuition reduction.   (
