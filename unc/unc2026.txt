Dear Class:

Your final exam score has been posted on WA under Final Exam.  The formula used to compute your course score is in the syllabus.  The grading scale is also in the syllabus.

Official course grades have been submitted and should be available on Connect Carolina.  

If you would like to view your final exam, please make arrangements with your instructor to stop by his/her office next semester.

The only grade changes are for clerical error in computing or recording the final course score/grade.  No other grade changes will be approved.  There is no re-grading, making up missed work, or extra credit. 

Best of luck to those of you moving onto Math 231 next semester.  You will start with limits (as x -> a, f(x) -> ___), continuity, and the limit definition of the derivative (the difference quotient).

It was a pleasure working with each and every one of you this semester.  Have a great Summer break!
