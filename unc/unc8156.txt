Good evening, Burch Silicon Val!

I can't believe it's time for your pitches already! I hope to see some of t=
hem tomorrow.  What a crazy week, eh?

As promised, I wanted to send along the apartment details for those living =
there. The Dean of Students will be sending an arrival email shortly.
Atherton Park Apartments
1670 El Camino Real
Menlo Park, CA 94025

An important reminder: if you are not staying in the program appointed hous=
ing, even for a night, you are required to complete the very simple Google =
form here.  This is not negotiable =
and it was very irresponsible, particularly in a snow storm, for us not to =
be able to tell parents where you were if needed. I know it's not the same =
as staying on campus.  You have a lot of other freedoms this semester and w=
e are counting on you to observe this minor inconvenience.

Thanks much for being your awesome selves and I hope you have a great night=
!

Best,
