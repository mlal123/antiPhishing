ry 158:  An alert student pointed out to me that I never posted the =
topic of paper #2, which was supposed to have been posted earlier in the we=
ek. In a semester of firsts, this is another one. I never forgot to post a =
paper assignment before. I should clearly have my head examined.  An=
yway, I've now posted the topic at Sakai under the Assignments folder. And =
I'm pasting it in here. Note that I'm going to push the due date out to Wed=
nesday, April 13, which still gives you eleven days to work on a three-page=
 paper. I think that should be enough. (For what it's worth, in the past I =
gave 7-9 days for these assignments. And students rarely encountered any di=
fficulties. I was experimenting with a new schedule this semester--and=
 it was working fine until I forgot to post the second assignment. Shucks.)=
     Hist=
ory 158 (Smith), Spring 2016.     Write an 800-900 word =
essay in response to the following.  (Please include a word count on y=
our cover page and please re-read the Smith Midterm Info document posted to=
 Sakai.) Remember that you=E2=80=99re writing a historical essay that requi=
res evidence, so cite sources often. (One rule of thumb: cite a source =
five times per page.)     Good luck!   =
  In the unraveling of the medieval synthesis, a process that was ac=
celerated by the Reformation and its long aftermath, the domains of human a=
ttention and activity became increasingly compartmentalized=E2=80=94distinc=
t from one another, conceived through different terms, regulated by differe=
nt authorities. In this essay, describe and compare the contributions of Ri=
chelieu and Galileo to this compartmentalizing process. Did they seek merel=
y to separate spheres of authority, elevate one type of authority over anot=
her, or both? On what grounds did they make claims for new kinds of authori=
ty? How did their attempts to buttress authority reflect the broader social=
/religious/political contexts in which they operated? (Note that this last =
question requires that you incorporate some material from lecture in writin=
g your essay, even though the essay focuses especially on the Galileo and R=
ichelieu texts.) ----------------------This forwarded message wa=
