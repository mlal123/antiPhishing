I
have a big U.S. Department of Education grant called The Finish Line, that
focuses on programs and supports for undergraduates who are first in their
family to go to college. We have an experimental study for which we need a
programming person. In brief, a student takes a survey (ETS) and gets
scores. The survey is called SuccessNavigator and it is designed to help
students figure out where their strengths are. We would like the scores for
the survey to be grabbed and then read into a premade =E2=80=9Cscore report=
=E2=80=9D
depending on experimental condition. The score report should be in either
word or pdf and then will be sent to the student. I am willing to pay by
the hour or by the job =E2=80=94 whatever might be most efficient. We are r=
eady to
start at any time! Contact me (Abigail Panter) directly at panter@unc.edu w=

*Web Design/Management PT Job (Virtual)                                 *As
a business consultant in the Mid-Atlantic region, I am looking for a person
to create and manage a web site with links to Facebook and other social
media for one of my small business owners.  The candidate should possess
the skills necessary to create and maintain an online presence for small
businesses.  The initial web site design will include pictures and print in
3 or 4 categories.  I will welcome your suggestions as to the wording and
design. This is a remote position and you would be working out of your home
or dorm and must be able to manage your time to produce the needed results.=
 The
initial web design and set up work will be paid in a lump sum with ongoing
monthly pay for keeping the web site and other social media posts up to
date. There is more work possible based on the success of this launch. If
you are interested please contact me at kimberlyrau@hotmail.com. Please

*Web-App Project (Paid/Virtual)*

I want to create a program that will compare the prices of all products on
retail websites like Wal-Mart and Target with Amazon's price and be able to
save all of the products that fit my price and sales rank parameters. The
program will be a web-app that can crawl through online stores (Walmart,
Target, Best Buy, Amazon, etc) and analyze prices with Amazon's price (Done
through the title, UPC's or ASIN's).  The app should run in the browser and
use a document database (MongoDB preferred).  The back-end should be
written preferably in Node JS.  Front end should be a basic dashboard style
with a modern JavaScript framework (Angular, backbone, or ember will do).
The app should be configured for cloud deployment. This is a single project
that should be completed in a relatively short time. If it is successful it
could lead to more projects throughout the year as more websites are added.=
 Pay
will be $30/hour, or fee based, depending on the agreement made with the
applicant. Please submit your resume. Include a paragraph on how your
skills and experience would be a fit for this project. Feel free to email
me with any questions. I have a detailed mock up. Thank you,Christopher
