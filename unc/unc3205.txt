From: Dylan Glotzer (dglotzer) - dglotzer@live.unc.eduHello all,  Here is a list of topics that you can expect to find on the upcoming =
midterm Wednesday 11/2.  ~~~  Chapter 3:  Random varia=
bles: probability distributions for discrete random variables, computing va=
riance/standard deviation for discrete random variables  Linear comb=
inations of random variables: mean and variance/standard deviation for line=
ar combinations of random variables (i.e. of the form aX + bY), includi=
ng when r.v.'s are independent and when not independent (includes corr=
elation rho)  Chapter 4:  Bernoulli & Binomial distributi=
ons: mean and variance/s.d. of each, "binomial setting", bin=
omial probability formula, cumulative probability  Binomial approxim=
ation to normal distribution: including continuity correction, approximatio=
n using sample proportion (p^hat)  Geometric distribution: mean and =
variance/s.d., "setting", relation to Bernoulli  Chapter 5=
:  Parameters, Statistics and Estimates; point estimates  Sam=
pling distribution of the sample mean (X^bar): mean and variance/s.d.  =
Confidence intervals for the population mean: confidence level,   Central limit theorem  Hypothesis testing using confidence int=
ervals  Decision errors: type 1 error rate (alpha, as opposed to con=
fidence level (1-alpha) )  ~~~  As always, let me know if you=
 have questions.       ---------------------=
