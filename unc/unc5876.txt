From: Ray Wang (raywang) - raywang@live.unc.eduHi All,  I'm =
providing some updated instructions regarding Poll Everywhere, in preparati=
on for Thursday. Those of you that texted an answer directly to 22333 and d=
id not receive an automated response asking you to register, your results w=
ent through (125 of you). However, a large number of you were unable t=
o respond: this will hopefully address the issue.  1. You MUST link =
your phone number to your account to register and for us to count your resp=
onses. First, register for an account online (through a computer, preferabl=
y) if you have not already (https://www.polleverywhere.com/register?p=3D1ja=
c-1a5v). Register and head to the home page once you've logged in. On the t=
op right of your screen, there should be a gear icon and your username. Cli=
ck it, and then click Settings.  2. Make sure your email is your UNC=
 email address, NOT your personal email such as gmail. We will be using you=
r ONYEN to check attendance, so please use your @live.unc.edu email=
 address so we can extract your ONYEN. Your username should b=
e a series of numbers by default; feel free to swap it out for your ONYEN i=
f you wish, although this should hopefully not be necessary.  3. Ent=
er your mobile phone number in the corresponding box. It should ask you to =
confirm your number by texting CERTIFY to 22333 from your phone. Do so, and=
 you should receive a confirmation text.  4. Now, to check if you ca=
n respond to questions. I've left today's poll up. You have 2 options to re=
spond if you have the app:  a. On your phone, if you have the app, s=
elect 'I'm participating' and enter the presentation URL: PollEv.com/econ12=
5. From here, select one of the two options, and you should receive a confi=
rmation message at the top telling you your submission was successful. =
 b. Alternatively, you could respond directly with a keyword instead of =
joining a presentation; the keywords would be choice1 or choice2 in this sp=
ecific case.  Finally, you can also text to 22333 directly with 'cho=
ice1' or 'choice2', although you will NOT receive a confirmation text, so I=
 suggest using the app if you have that option available. Note that keyword=
s may change depending on the poll.     That should do i=
t. If you have any problems, I will be available after class on Thursday to=
 go through the steps.  Cheers,  Ray -----------------=
