Interested in graduate school?  I have group set up for information about
graduate schools.  Rather than sending out future emails to all majors,
from now on they will only go to the gradschools list.  In order to join,
go to
https://groups.google.com/a/cs.unc.edu/forum/?hl=en#!forum/gradschools-cs and
join.  You will need to register with your CS account.  I hope that it is
set up to allow you to join and leave without my intervention.  Meanwhile,
here is today's announcement.
