Dear Dr. Ringel,

Hope this email finds you well.

I=92m Mike Guo from your BUSI 406-003 class. One of our teammate made a mis=
take in the header/footer of the final project and the file name. It should=
 be "group 6" instead of "group 7=94.

Apologize for any inconveniences caused.

Thank you and have a good weekend!

Best Regards,
Mike
