Hi Mangza -

I just wanted to let you know that as of the pay period that ended on
Sunday, 4/16 you have 40.24 work study hours left available for this
spring.  Please keep an eye on your time card - once you use up those hours you
cannot work for the rest of the semester.

The last day you can work for work study this spring is May 9th.  Please
work with your TIM supervisor to adjust your schedule (if needed) so you
don't go over your allocation.

Please don't hesitate to ask any questions or check in with me about your
balance.  You can also track your progress on the Google spreadsheet that
was shared with you at the beginning of the fall semester.

Thanks,


Beth
