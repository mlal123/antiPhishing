What is the case about?=
  The case challenges an alleged agreement between the Duke Defend=

 monetary relief from the Duke Defendants.  Dr. Seaman alleges that th=
e No-Hire Agreement violates state and federal antitrust laws, and resulted=
 in suppressed mobility and compensation of certain employees of Duke and U=
NC.  The Duke Defendants and the UNC Defendants deny these allegations=
.  Dr. Seaman is not seeking money damages in the settlement with the =
UNC Defendants because money damages are not available due to UNC’s r=
ole as a state agency.  However, Seaman’s claims for money damag=
es against the Duke Defendants have not been settled, and those claims will=
