If you are a junior and considering doing an honors thesis next year, we
should talk.  There are research funds available from the honors program.
There are limitations to what the funds can be used for but if you know
what your research topic is likely to be, we should start the process of
connecting you with an adviser and applying for the grant money.  If you
are interested, please come see me.  Preference is to find some of walk-in
advising hours that work for you but if that's not possible, we should
schedule time to talk.
