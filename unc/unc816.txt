Hello,


You're talking about the footnotes, correct? If that's so, it's probably=
 better to cite the name of the editor and the page. As long as it's clear =
what text you're citing, it's fine.

Hey emma, sorry this is last minute but i forgot to mention it. There ar=
e some information at the bottom of Medea and they provided factual informa=
tion about the status of women in society so I'm just going to cite those i=
nformation as (Eurpidies, Medea,
 pg #). Is that fine?
