From: Buck Goldstein (goldstb) - buck_goldstein@unc.eduThe assignme=
nts are beginning to come together into a clearer picture of the business o=
r enterprise where you are doing your internship.  This week I got som=
e insight into whether there is a sustainable business model.  In some=
 cases, the answer is yes but for most, the question has yet to be answered=
 and that applies to some very big companies as well as some of the early s=
tage ones.  You should keep thinking about the sustainability of the e=
nterprise throughout the semester.  Don't just drink the Kool-Aid.&nbs=
p; Even if you don't express your doubts, it is okay to have them and to co=
ntinue to ask polite but penetrating questions to help you understand bette=
r what the business model actually is (if there is one) and is it working.<=
