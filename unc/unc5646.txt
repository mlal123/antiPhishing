						Each year, student interns from the Office of Undergraduate=
 Retention work closely with professional staff to host a conference on stu=
dent success. Usually, this conference is held in the spring and led&n=
bsp;by education professionals. The content is geared toward enriching the =
staff of the University.
					
						This spring we would like to host our own confere=
nce – a conference by students for students. Through this conference,=
 we hope to empower each other to thrive at Carolina both inside and outsid=
e the classroom. This is an opportunity for us to make our voices heard and=
 appreciate our varied student body as we discuss the factors that go into =
thriving at UNC.
					
						Because this is all about students, we invite you to share =
the topics you want to learn about. Your input will greatly influence =
the planning and execution of this event, and we hope to continue to engage=
 the students of UNC throughout this process. Please complete =
this brief survey to provide thoughts on what your student=
 success conference should look like. We would like to receive as many=
 responses as possible by July 14th, so please complete it and f=
orward it to your friends.
