Short Course Spotlight: Designing Multi-Item Scales with Bob DeVellis (

Date: April 12, 2018
 Time: 1:00pm - 5:00pm
 Location: Davis Library Room 219

This course provides an introduction to developing instruments with multiple items to measure a single construct. Examples include measures of various
social and psychological variables that might be assessed in health, marketing, journalism, or other research areas. Participants will also be
encouraged to suggest content areas for discussion.
After a brief theoretical introduction, we will turn to practical issues such as when a multi-item scale is (or isn’t) appropriate, determining the
number and content of items in the scale, what type and how many response options should be offered, whether scales should include both “negative”
and “positive” items, whether the parts of a subscale should be grouped or scattered, and other common concerns in scale development.
Dr. DeVellis will use real-life examples to demonstrate the scale development process. There will be ample opportunity for questions and discussion.
Instructor: Robert DeVellis, Research Professor, UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health and author of Scale Development: Theory and Applications
3rd ed. published 2012 by Sage Publications.
This course will count as 4.0 CPSM short course hours.

R Open Labs

March 22, 29 | 2:00pm - 3:30pm | Davis Library Research Hub
 Open labs are (mostly) unstructured workshops designed to help you learn R. Each week brief instruction will be provided, followed by time to
practice, work together, ask questions and get help. Participants can join the lab any time during the session, and are welcome to work on unrelated
projects.
