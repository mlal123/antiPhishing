ETIQUETTE TIP: Quick Tips for Restaurant Dining
Some quick pointers:

*         Place your napkin on your lap immediately upon sitting (folded si=
de toward your body).

*         Order by saying something like, "I'd like the grilled chicken pla=
tter." Do not say, "Can I have the grilled chicken platter?"

*         Once you place your order, hand the server your menu.

*         Remember that your drinks are always on your right; your bread & =
butter plate is on your left. Don't make the mistake of picking up the one =
intended for the person sitting next to you.

*         When finished eating, do not push your plate forward. Simply plac=
e your silverware diagonally across your plate (think of the 4:10 position =
on a clock) to signal that you have finished.
