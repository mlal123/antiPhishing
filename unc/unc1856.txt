We continue to make progress on getting our course numbers correct.  There
are 5 courses that are currently filled: 283, 410, 455, 523, and 550.
There are also a number of courses that have reserved capacity.  If you
were blocked by the reserved seats, some of those have been released and
you may want to recheck.  The rest are being held for first-year and
transfer students.  These will not be released until the beginning of the
fall semester.  We continue to work to maximize the seats available and I
will be keeping an eye on availability throughout the summer.

Meanwhile, we can only help you if we know that you are trying to get into
a class.  Please submit this google form  for
courses that you want to get into (one course per form).  If you are trying
to get into a course with reserved seats, you should add the course number
in the "other" field.

Thanks,
