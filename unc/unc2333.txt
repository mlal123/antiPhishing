"Unique, fast-paced internship opportunity with a Fantasy Sports Startup
founded by UNC alums. Our company, Sideline, recently went live and we are
looking to bring on a Full-Stack developer for this semester. This will be
a really fun, challenging, and engaging opportunity to work on all
spectrum's of the site - we are constantly iterating on all aspects to make
sure we are bringing the best product to market possible. You'll work
directly with our head developer - and you, along with the all of our users
will see the results of your work weekly, in action!

If you're considering going into the Startup world, this is a great chance
to see it from the ground floor, while building your portfolio and getting
cool experience. You also get to work with a really supportive, engaged
team. I promise it will be as good as it sounds.
