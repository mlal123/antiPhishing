nces:

 

As the semester draws to a close, please mark your calendar =
to check your academic eligibility status in ConnectCarolina. You will see =
that your eligibility status for continued enrollment has been calculated b=
y the Registrar once the posting of final grades is nearly complete.  =
This will probably be around May 17, 2018.  The Registrar will =
send instructions for finding your eligibility status prior to that date.

 

Your academic standing is based on grades, hours attempted, =
hours passed, and the number of semesters completed. If you have grades tha=
t have not yet been posted on May 17, be aware that your eligibility status=
 might change once all your grades are displayed, so you might need to chec=
k your status more than once.

If you are concerned about your academic eligibility status =
for entering Summer Session I, Summer Session II, or Fall 2018, I strongly =
encourage you to meet with an academic advisor either in Academic Advising =
or in the Office of Retention during drop-in hours to discuss options to re=
store your academic eligibility.

 

Please note:  Summer Session I classes will begin on Ma=
y 16 (while Spring 2018 grades are still being posted).  Students who =
are concerned that they *might* not be in good standing for SSI after the S=
pring grades are posted should go ahead and submit appeals concernin=
g academic eligibility well in advance of Summer Session I, noting the foll=
owing deadlines:

demic probation in order to enter Summer =
Session I, 2018 should be submitted by 5pm on Tuesday,=
