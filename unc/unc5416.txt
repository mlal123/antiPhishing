From: Valerie Lambert (vlambert) - vlambert@email.unc.eduDear Stude=
nts,  There was an error in the posting of the final grades for ANTH=
 102.  In an email yesterday, I received from the TAs only the last ex=
am grades and recitation  grades.  I thus assumed that the grades=
 that were posted on sakai under the heading 'course grade' in the gradeboo=
k were the correct course grades since I had received nothing else from the=
m.  I added the extra credit points and posted these grades as course =
grades.  These grades were not the actual course grades, however. =
 The TAs just sent me the list of the actual course grades, which I saw =
for the first time this morning.  This then means that all of the grad=
es will have to be re-done.  I apologize for the consternation this wi=
ll cause you.  Nothing like this has ever happened in the 16 years tha=
t I have taught this course.  I apologize again.  Professor Lam=
