We will be piloting the university's online learning contract management
system for fall.  It's pretty straightforward and will help our management
of learning contracts.

Students,  I will be updating the department website next week.  Please
wait until then to submit.

Faculty,  I will send out a cheat sheet next week and give an update at the
first opportunity at a faculty meeting.

Thanks,
Diane
