Hey Mangza,

It's been a long time since we last saw you. How's it going on
your end?

We've been over here adding new features like ABC voting,
click-and-change color schemes, Flickr image search for
backgrounds,
clickable image polls, ranking polls, Q&A / Brainstorm polls...
It's a lot.

We're even making the old features better, with new apps and
widgets that seamlessly integrate with PowerPoint. (Web slides
that load instantly in your presentation! What??)

You should stop by ( http://polleverywhere.com/my/polls ). Take a
look at the cool, new tricks ( http://www.polleverywhere.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-poll-everywhere/ ) you can do with your Poll Everywhere polls, to keep your
audience tuned in and having fun!

If you're having trouble, we're here all day to answer your
questions. Shoot me an email, and I'll help you out!

Always working hard for you,
