About matching parametric equation to graphs

Hi,=C2=A0

I am confused about how to match graphs for (a) and (e)=C2=A0

For instance, the z vector in (a) is e^-t. Does it mean that as t increases=
 (e^-t decreases) , the circle will move downward to the negative z-axis or=
 does it mean the circle will still move upward (since e^-t always >0) but =
just moving at a slower rate?

Thank you!=C2=A0
