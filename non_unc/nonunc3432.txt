Test case 4 is really this test case. Meant to be in the final grader, so s=
poilers ahead :)


Apologies here....so test case x was meant to be in the real grader but it =
kind of leaked in here. Meant to be a tough case that would really stress y=
our implementation. So here is the dump for it:
addNode(0, 4)addNode(1, 1)addNode(2, 8)addNode(3, 2)addNode(4, 7)addNode(5,=
 5)addEdge(0, 2, 5, 0, null)addEdge(1, 4, 7, 0, null)addEdge(2, 1, 8, 0, nu=
ll)addEdge(3, 2, 8, 0, null)addEdge(4, 4, 5, 0, null)addEdge(5, 1, 2, 0, nu=
ll)addEdge(6, 1, 5, 0, null)addEdge(7, 1, 7, 0, null)addEdge(8, 8, 5, 0, nu=
ll)addEdge(9, 1, 4, 0, null)addEdge(10, 5, 7, 0, null)addEdge(11, 4, 2, 0, =
null)addEdge(12, 8, 7, 0, null)addEdge(13, 4, 8, 0, null)addEdge(14, 2, 7, =
0, null)ind(1) < ind(4) < ind(2) < ind(8) < ind(5) < ind(7)
=C2=A0
Note that if you can't get this one it is not the end of the world. This on=
e is supposed to be up there in tougher test cases.
