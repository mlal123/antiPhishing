Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

Grade A5  (11/21/16 7:31 PM)

It says I failed one of the del node case and topo sort cases. I wrote up t=
he cases in playground and they seem to work. Has anyone else had this issu=
e? I am worried that maybe my latest submission wasn't graded.
