Chris asked a great follow-up question so I=E2=80=99m replying to all.=20

I personally manage the placement process for all companies in my network. =
 Please do not contact those companies directly until I have connected you =
by email.  After learning what the companies are seeking and offering throu=
gh their program and reviewing your resumes and priority list, I make refer=
rals to the companies and to you.  Some companies ask me to send more than =
one resume... they prefer to interview candidates before confirming placeme=
nt.  It=E2=80=99s a collaborative, iterative process that is often very eff=
icient.

If you are seeking an internship with a company I do not know, you should a=
lready be in direct contact.  I will only get involved at the end to send t=
he internship agreement once confirmed.=20
If you aren=E2=80=99t sure if I know a company, you are welcome to email me=
.  You should have a list of the companies that hosted internships and site=
 visits last year.   Those are all in my network.=20

Thanks.  Jen
