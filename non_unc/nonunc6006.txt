Gradescope + questions are up

Hi all,

You should be able to view the worksheets and their associated questions on Gradescope now. There are 3 worksheets with 3, 2 and 2 questions respectively.

You have to upload your solutions as PDF files. When you upload to Gradescope, you will be asked to mark out in your PDF which pages correspond to which solutions.

Please let us know if you have any problems with this.
