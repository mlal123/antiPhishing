A5 Jedi

I doubt there are any TAs looking at this as you are all hopefully enjoying your spring break, but if there is, would you mind looking at my submission for a5Jedi? I'm currentyly debugging but a second pair of eyes would be very much appreciated. I've created a bunch of IF statements that try and determine the next move based on location (whether the iterator is on the edges, a corner, or within the body) and the last move made. In my hasNext(), i told it to return false simply if the x and y >= the width - 1 and height - 1 respectively. Unfortunately, I'm receiving failures (not errors) and can't find where I'm returning the wrong thing, even using the JUnit. Anyways, a second pair of eyes would be much appreciated!
Thank You, and have a nice spring break!!
