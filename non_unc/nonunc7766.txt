theres been a lot of rude and frankly annoying statements lately that have =
gotten on my nerves (and almost certainly the instructors=C2=A0and T/LAs as=
 well).

so i =C2=A0wanted to thank the instructors for their work. I know that ther=
e are a lot of us that appreciated the time that the TAs and LAs set out to=
 help us as well as the work that Dr. Pizer put in to making the videos and=
 exercises and helping the students that came to his office hours. this was=
n't an easy class for us, so I can imagine that it was a lot of hard work t=
o grade and organize exercises while also taking classes of your own/doing =
your own research. thank you for your hard work! have a good winter break a=
nd to the grad and undergrad assistants, good luck on the exams you have co=
ming up.
