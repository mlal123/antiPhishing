**Good Morning and Happy Friday!**

Alright guys, I have a situation I need advice on, because this keeps hap=
pening to me. Making friends used to be super easy.=C2=A0

"Hi, we both like blue crayons, let's pretend to be dragons." Boom. You'd=
 be best friends for 10 years. Now, it's easier and less awkward to get a=
 date than to ask someone to ... hang out? Go on a friend date? Grab coff=
ee? Adults grab coffee, right?

I have encountered numerous situations like this in college, including in=
 life right now. I just want to be able to give someone my number or ask =
them to hang out without it being weird. Or ... I guess ... give them my =
Snapchat? Isn't that what Millenials are doing these days?

While I spend the weekend figuring out how to make adult friends, check o=
ut a really important story and the background behind it. =C2=A0=C2=A0
