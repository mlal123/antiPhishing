Your classmate posted a new Question.=20

1c

I've tried using the substitution method on this problem, but can't figure =
out how to get rid of the multiplicative constant:
$$T(N)=3DT(\frac{\sqrt{N}}{5})+1$$
If I substitute with $$m=3Dlog_2(N)$$, then I get:
$$T(2^m)=3DT(\frac{2^{m/2}}{5})+1$$

But I get stuck here. I'm not sure how I can remove=C2=A0$$\frac{1}{5}$$ fr=
om within $$T$$ on the right-hand side of the equation to allow for the sub=
stitution of $$S(m)=3DT(2^{m})$$. Can anyone provide suggestions as to how =
I might progress?
