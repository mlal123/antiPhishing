Lab 7 - weird "diff" output

So I have a weird issue. For Ex 2, all my results vs. test outputs match, with the exception of Ex 2-4 and Ex 2-5. Here, I get the following strange diff output:

diff ex2res4.pgm ex2out4.pgm2d1< 1013a3> 101
diff ex2res5.pgm ex2out5.pgm
2d1
< 76
3a3
> 76
What exactly is different? I really can't tell.(Yes, I know this is going to be late, and I'm pushing it as is lol.)
