Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
delMin when there is an even number of nodes  (9/30/16 9:25 PM)

Hey all,

I am pretty stumped on how to write=C2=A0delMin to handle a heap with an ev=
en number of nodes, meaning one of the nodes I encounter will only have one=
 child, so I do not compare the left and right children.

How should I think through the check that I include for this possibility?

Also, is it better to write delMin with a while-loop or a for-loop?

Thank you!
