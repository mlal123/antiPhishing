Reminder - regrading

Hi all,

General reminder - for regrading the homework assignments, you must approach us during office hours and discuss what changes you are looking for. It is not enough to email us, or to ask us during class hours, or to send a regrade request on Gradescope. You must meet us in office hours! The procedure is

1. Check @141 to see who graded which question. If you don't find what you're looking for, email us and we'll tell you who graded what.
2. Visit that TA during their TA office hours. No need to set up an appointment, just walk in.
3. We'll regrade your question on the spot.

Best regards,
Rohan
