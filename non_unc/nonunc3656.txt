Hello Mangza

I know you're starting to get busy with end of the semester papers and exam study, so I'll keep this email short.

I work for DormBooks, a student-run business that buys back textbooks for more money than the campus bookstore during finals week. We offer dorm room pick up and publish all our prices online. We are currently hiring student buyback agents at UNC and I was wondering if you would be interested in working for us?

You can work any hours you wish before and during finals week and make yourself a little extra Christmas spending money. Last December, the median agent made $172, with several agents making $800+.

Sincerely,
