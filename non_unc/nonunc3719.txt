Directly Mapped Cache  (12/04/16 10:30 PM)

I understand how this caching system works. I am just really confused about=
 how to convert an address like 1008d into the binary representation shown =
on slide 18 of the Memory Heirarchy ppt. Essentially how do we get from
1008d >=C2=A001111110000b?

Are all branch instructions considered pipeline hazards?  (12/05/16 1:41 AM)

The book says there are 2 solutions, one which is to stall (which I assume =
is a pipeline hazard), the other is to predict (which will only cause a sta=
ll if we need to branch). I assume the latter is still considered a hazard.
