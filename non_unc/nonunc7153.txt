Exercise:
False alarms in intrusion detection systems Suppose there is 1 intrusion attempt per every 1,000,000 network packets received at a corporate network. The corporation uses a network based intrusion detection system, which has a true positive rate (sensitivity) of 95% and a false positive rate of 0.1%. What is the probability that an alarm represents an actual intrusion attempt?
