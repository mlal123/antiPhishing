As the Carolina Union nears its 50th anniversary, we need your assistance planning for the future. Share your #UNCUnionIdeas, and help shape the direction of the Union by completing our brief survey. 

Completing the survey will automatically enter you into our 10 daily and 4 grand prize drawings. Winners will be randomly selected and prizes include, but are not limited to, Bluetooth speakers, Yeti tumblers, Carolina apparel, and Apple watches.

The Feasibility Study includes an extensive exploration into the functionality of the current FPG Student Union facility and student life at UNC-Chapel Hill. The effort is being led by our Carolina Union Board of Directors (BOD). It is designed to identify the needs of the Carolina community and evaluate areas of improvement. Your participation in our survey is critical to the success of the project.
