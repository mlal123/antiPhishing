Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

URGENT: Lab 6 Problem Source Solved  (12/07/16 11:30 AM)

Looking around I think I found why so many people are having problems with =
lab 6.=C2=A0

Early on in the submission time of lab 7 the submit had an error where it w=
ould send files to lab 6. This was later fixed, but I think for people that=
 may have submitted prior to this being fixed overwrote their old lab 6 wit=
h their lab 7. I investigated this and have a screenshot of what I found.=
=C2=A0


Basically my lab6 ex1.c and ex2.c were overwritten with my lab7 file. Only =
difference is between a change I made between my first lab 7 submit, and th=
e final one that had the corrected script. I think this is why so many peop=
le are having problems. This also makes sense because within the folder I h=
ave an ex1.asm and ex2.asm and these are not part of lab6, we didn't do .as=
m until lab 7.=C2=A0



I think the lab 7 overwriting lab 6 is why everyone is having problems.=C2=
=A0
