Problem Set 3 grading is finally finished  (11/14/16 1:05 AM)

Problem 2 of PS3 wasn't entirely graded for a long time; in particular, gra=
ding for parts C (the one about=C2=A0ori $1,$0,-1) and D (the one about the=
=C2=A0lw $t2, $t0(4*$t1) pseudoinstruction) weren't finished. That's becaus=
e I was supposed to grade these, but I was delayed for various reasons. The=
y are all graded now; those of you who were unhappy with your zeroes (parti=
