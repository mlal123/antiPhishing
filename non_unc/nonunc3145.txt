Object scope in Java

I'm having a weird problem that I don't quite=C2=A0understand.
My splay() method will splay the nodes correctly inside the method itself, =
but once it finishes the method, the object becomes null.

So for example, if I do something like:
BST_Node newInsertedNode =3D new BST_Node(s);=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 ne=
wInsertedNode.par =3D this;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 newInsertedNode.spla=
y();
The new Node will act correctly within the splay method. But once the metho=
d is finished, the newInsertedNode becomes null. It will=C2=A0return a Null=
PointerException when trying to do something like
System.out.println("Data of the new node is "+newInsertedNode.getData());

How does the scope of objects work in Java? Can somebody please tell me wha=
t I am=C2=A0doing wrong here?
Thank you.
