y/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth)
=E2=80=9CMuch has been written about Facebook and Twitter=E2=80=99s impact=
 on politics=2C but in recent months academics have speculated that YouTub=
e=E2=80=99s algorithms may have been instrumental in fueling disinformatio=

=E2=80=9CThat is=2C if the potential we envisioned for them was ever truly=
 alive. The technology to make AI-powered assistants truly useful is still=

More than half of Facebook Instant Articles partners may have abandoned it=

AdExchanger / Alessandro De Zanche
A publisher=E2=80=99s paywall strategy is about more than the bottom line=
 =E2=86=92 (https://adexchanger.com/the-sell-sider/publishers-paywall-stra=
tegy-bottom-line/)
=E2=80=9CThe view that adding a paywall to request payment in exchange for=
 user access to content as simply a new revenue opportunity would be misle=
ading and dangerous. Before publishers can decide which paywall model make=
s the most sense for their business=2C they must examine their own identit=
y and audience. These factors are=2C in my opinion=2C the root causes of t=
he bumpy road that many publishers find themselves traveling.=E2=80=9D
Digiday / Max Willens
Flipboard cozies up to Facebook-weary publishers =E2=86=92 (https://digida=

There are two big problems with Facebook=E2=80=99s new =E2=80=9Ctrusted so=
