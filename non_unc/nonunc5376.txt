Here's what has happened in MATH 233 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
parametrizations  (5/02/17 9:45 PM)

I just wanted to double-check that when a problem asks for a parametrizatio=
n on the exam, there will be multiple correct examples. E.g. for the follow=
ing problem, I let y =3D t and got the parametrization r(t) =3D=C2=A0$$-5t^=
2 + 12, t, \sqrt{4-t^2}>$$ Would this also work?=C2=A0

Thank you!!
