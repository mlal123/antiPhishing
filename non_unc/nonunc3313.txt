Problem 4  (11/01/16 2:15 PM)

Can someone explain what we are supposed to be doing for problem 4? I'm not=
 sure I understand what they are asking/what we are supposed to be doing.

Question 3 connections  (11/01/16 3:04 PM)

In both question 3B and 3C there are connections (p-types B and D respectiv=
ely) that aren't connected to Y, but the wires do cross. I think it would b=
e kind of outrageous to just assume that because the wires do cross, that t=
hese p-types are connected to Y. If this is indeed the case, then the probl=
em set should be amended to include the dot that specifies a wire connectio=
n. There is an example in slides 28-29 of the transistors 1 ppt that imply =
the same kind of connection without the dot, slide 27 has examples that inc=
lude the dot.

Are we supposed to judge wire connections based on the complement in the n-=
type network? What exactly are we supposed to be doing?

 the resources file in sakai. =C2=A0Is there another way for me to access t=
his slide?
