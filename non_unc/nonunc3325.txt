Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Return type of Splay  (11/02/16 2:26 PM)

Hey all,
If you have a moment, would you mind explaining what the return type of spl=
ay() should be?

I am not getting an intact Splay tree after trying to insert more than one =
node into the=C2=A0tree. Using a System.out.println(), the program is indic=
ating that it does find the correct condition for splaying a node, (e.g. wh=
en it is supposed to call rotateLeft(), it does). However, the tree itself =
seems to disappear!

Here is an example of what is happening:

IN SPLT Playground:
SPLT tree2=3D new SPLT();    tree2.insert("hello");    printLevelOrder(tree=
2);
returns: =C2=A0
Level 0:hello=C2=A0

Yet when attempting to insert a second node:=C2=A0

    SPLT tree2=3D new SPLT();
    tree2.insert("hello");
    tree2.insert("world");
    printLevelOrder(tree2);
=C2=A0returns:
Current parent is: null
Rotating Left:=C2=A0

Any/all help is appreciated! Please let me know if I should include more in=
formation.

Thank you!
