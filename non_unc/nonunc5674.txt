This is the Web Without Net Neutrality
--------------------------------------

The FCC wants to change the rules that govern the Internet,
allowing big corporations to control what we see and do online.
Without Net Neutrality, loading screens could become the new
normal.

Codecademy and many of your favorite websites rely on Net
Neutrality, so we've teamed up with hundreds of other tech
organizations to fight for it =E2=80=93 but we need your help.

* Today is our day of protest =E2=80=93 spread the word on social
media.
* Inform yourself about the issues =E2=80=93 make it easy with videos ( htt=
ps://youtu.be/fpbOEoRrHyU ) and gifs ( https://netneutrality.internetassoci=
ation.org/action/ )!
* Tell the FCC what you think with the link below.

We've won before, and we can win again. Together, we can keep
the open Internet we all love and deserve.
