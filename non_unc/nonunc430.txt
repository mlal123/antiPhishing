Hi disc golf participants,

I'm having some trouble with IM Leagues, so I'm sending out this update
through my personal email.

Unfortunately due to the unplayable condition of the course, and the
possibility of adverse weather, the tournament is cancelled for today. We
are looking at dates to hold the tournament, so look out for an email with
updates.

Sorry!
