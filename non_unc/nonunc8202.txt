Dear Internship Sponsors,



My colleagues at UNC-Chapel Hill, Honors Carolina and our Shuford Program
in Entrepreneurship join me in expressing our appreciation for your support
of our program.  Our students arrived this weekend and are looking forward
to meeting you tomorrow morning.



Tomorrow morning is intended to be a half-day orientation / onboarding
opportunity for interns.  Students are in residence at Menlo College this
semester and have campus orientation there tomorrow afternoon.



Tuesday will be their first full day onsite at their internships.  They
will be with you Mondays =E2=80=93 Thursdays for the next thirteen weeks, a=
nd their
last day is April 19.
