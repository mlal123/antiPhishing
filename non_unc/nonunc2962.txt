New Folder: Muddiest Point

I am opening this "muddiest point" folder so you can post items telling me what you found to be the "muddiest point" from the days class session.

I will review these and hopefully give some replies intended to clear up the mud.
Perhaps address muddy items in subsequent class meetings.
