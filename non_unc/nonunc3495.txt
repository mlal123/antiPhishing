I broke something [HW5 Oracle]

So I was cruising along finishing this assignment, and after substituting in a different class for my DiGraph (wanted to preserve the original, semi-working version as I tried a new approach)... now the Oracle is freaking out. It gives me 0s on all tests, giving me the error message "no SPLT class found." Which is correct, there is no SPLT class in my Assignment 5 project lol. I have removed it from the build path, redownloaded it from Sakai, and re-put it in the build path... and it still very upset there is no SPLT class. I am absolutely certain I picked the A5 Sakai assignment, etc.
