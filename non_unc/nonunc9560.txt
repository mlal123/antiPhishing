Career Readiness:



Communication: Articulate thoughts and ideas clearly and
effectively in written and oral forms to persons inside and outside of the
organization. The individual has public speaking skills; is able to express
ideas to others; and can write/edit memos, letters, and complex technical
reports clearly and effectively. Take this opportunity to do a check-in=20
with yourself. Are you a good communicator? Are you a good listener? Could =
you
improve in any areas of your communication? =C2=A0  If you answered
"NO",  =C2=A0the good news is that communication is a skill that
you can continually improve  if you are willing to put in the time and
effort. =C2=A0  If you answered "YES! I am an excellent
communicator" I would challenge you to improve even more.  We can
always strive to be better! Communication skills are necessary in the world=
 of
work, no matter what path you take or destination you hope to land.
