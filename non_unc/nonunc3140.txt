Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
A4 splay method  (10/22/16 1:08 AM)

It says we are supposed to "write an internal method splay for SPLT". That means we should create a splay method for both BST_Node and SPLT?

------------------------------------------------------------
insert node then splay  (10/22/16 1:12 AM)

How are we are supposed to call the insert method as a normal BST, and then splay it to the root, if insert is being called recursively?
