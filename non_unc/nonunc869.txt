Assignment 4  (11/17/15 11:15 AM)

I had a question about when assignment 4 is due. Professor Aikat said it wa=
s extended until December 2nd and the website says both parts are due then,=
 but above that, the schedule still says part A is due tonight. Is that wro=
ng? Just want some clarification since it being due tonight is really diffe=
rent than being due in 2 weeks.=C2=A0
