University officials continued to monitor weather conditions throughout the night and the campus continues to operate as normal. Exams will continue as scheduled for Saturday, Dec. 9, 2017. Students coming to campus from outside the Chapel Hill area are encouraged to check the weather conditions in their area and work directly with their professor if there are any travel safety concerns.

The University will continue to monitor the forecast and current road conditions and communicate any change to campus operating status as early as possible. 

Your safety is our number one consideration. We rely on information from our grounds, public safety and transportation staffs, Chapel Hill Transit, law enforcement agencies, the National Weather Service, and other sources when deciding how the campus will operate during winter weather events. Please refer to alertcarolina.unc.edu for more information on how these decisions are made and communicated.
