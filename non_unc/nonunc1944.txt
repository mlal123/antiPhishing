More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.1.10

This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hos=
ted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the dest=
ination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email serve=
r, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If t=
he steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you'=
re the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:

The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient addres=
s exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.

Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are usi=
ng directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is syn=
ced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.

Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as=
 expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mail=
box forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules fe=
ature.

Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 l=
icense assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365=
 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipi=
ent > Assigned License > Edit).

Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow=
 or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flo=
w settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up=
 correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX recor=
ds for your domain are configured correctly.
