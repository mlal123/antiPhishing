Lovelace and Babbage: Partners in Code
--------------------------------------

Aspiring mathematician Ada Lovelace met ( https://www.wired.com/2008/06/day=
intech-0605/?utm_source=3Dcodecademy_newsletter ) Charles Babbage 184 years=
 ago this month. Babbage, a
mathematics professor at Cambridge, had just received funding for
his latest idea =E2=80=93 a machine that could perform mathematical
calculations.

Over the following years, Babbage and Lovelace worked
together ( https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/15/the-thrilling-adventure=
s-of-lovelace-and-babbage-sydney-padua/?utm_source=3Dcodecademy_newsletter =
) to create the general purpose computer. Charles designed the
hardware, while Ada wrote the complex software required to make
the first computer run.

Before she died, Ada Lovelace realized that their inventions
could tackle far more than math. Rather, a computer could
accomplish "whatever we know how to order it to perform."
