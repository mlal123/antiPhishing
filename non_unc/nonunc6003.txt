Here's what has happened in COMP 550.02 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Trouble solving recurrence relation variable change problem on Worksheet for lecture 4  (8/30/17 7:41 PM)

So we have T(n) = T(n^(1/2)) + T(n^(1/4)) + n^(1/2) and we use m = lg n
then we have S(m) = S(m/2) + S(m/4) + 2^(m/2)
I don't see any similar recurrences in the book so I assume that the only way to do this is through guess and check?
However I feel like there should be a better method or I'm doing something wrong here
