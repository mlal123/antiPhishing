Dear Carolina Community:

By now, most of you have read about the attempted kidnapping near our campu=
s this past weekend. Luckily, because of quick action on the part of the vi=
ctim and her friends and follow-up by the police, an arrest has been made. =
This incident was deeply alarming and unsettling to all of us. Your safety =
is our top priority. We are writing today to let you know about initiatives=
 to make our campus and town as safe as possible, and to provide you with i=
nformation for seeking assistance and resources.

We collaborate closely with the Chapel Hill Police Department (CHPD) and th=

In the fall, we initiated a working group of University, community and stud=
ent leaders led by Derek Kemp, associate vice chancellor for campus safety =

=E2=80=99s specific recommendations before the end of the fall semester and=
 will begin implementation as quickly as possible.=20
