Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Lowest assignment dropped  (11/15/15 4:16 PM)

So even though assignment 4 is split into two parts, its still just one grade right? As far as dropping an assignment goes, if you were to drop assignment 4 it would be the whole thing that's dropped and not just one part of it right?

dropping an assignment  (11/15/15 5:06 PM)

If we have made 100's on all of the assignments, are you still going to drop one, or is it possible to drop a Lab grade?

Difficulty with last Part 3 test  (11/15/15 5:52 PM)

I am having a hard time creating an identical object for this test. Every time I create a new object, and then try to run the test, I receive a message stating "Some of your tests failed to run due to a runtime error." I am not sure how to duplicate the colors without creating a new object and then returning said object. If anyone has any ideas, I'd love to hear them. Thanks!
