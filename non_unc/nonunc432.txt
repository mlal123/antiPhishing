Your classmate posted a new Question.=20

User input after K

Directly after printing K require the user to input any integer. This will =
cause the program to not end (or later loop) until the user inputs another =
number. However, your program need not store or use this input value.


Does this mean we should use a new scanner to detect keyboard input (exampl=
eNewScanner.hasNextInt();)?
Otherwise if I use the scanner that is used for the other functions, when i=
t repeats, it just takes that input and executes the corresponding story.

For example:

Type any number to continue.
1
B: You make yourself invisible but Malachy quickly retaliates by throwing
=C2=A0=C2=A0 anti-invisibility dust into the air. What now?
=C2=A0=C2=A0 Type 1 to stay still and hope the dust doesn't work(C). =C2=A0
=C2=A0=C2=A0 Type 2 to quickly move away from the dust(D).

Like this, it directly goes to B instead of asking for a new integer.

Therefore, is creating a new scanner for this the correct approach or is th=
ere another approach that I am missing?
