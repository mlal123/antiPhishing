Your classmate posted a new Question.=20

A2 questions clarification

In the assignment, it asks, 'What is the average number of trials it took y=
ou to break pre-image resistance based on 15 experiments?'=C2=A0

Does that mean that our algorithm need not return m1 every time it is run? =
Do we just cut execution time once 15 seconds have been reached during each=
 trial of the program?

Thanks!
