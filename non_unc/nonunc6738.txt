Here's what has happened in COMP 435 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Consistency in assignment examples  (10/10/17 12:08 PM)

Is there any reason for the fact that in both the pre-image and collision examples, the results:
start with a string of numbers of variable lengthend with the string 'fhjasbfjhebw'

For the pre-image task, generating random strings from the set of lowercase ASCII characters and digits takes consistently longer than 5 minutes - so I'm looking for any ideas on how to cut this time down.

The assignment also stresses that we do not use hard-coded values, but this string is consistent between two different functions.
