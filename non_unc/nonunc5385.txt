Midterm 3vF

I am wondering what should we do when the movement is clockwise instead of =
counterclockwise.=C2=A0
I set the r=3D<-3cost, -3sint> because the point is moving from (3,0) to (0=
,3) and set the boundary for t as from 0 to -pi/2. The answer i get is posi=
tive 54/3 instead of -54/3. But I don't know which part goes wrong. The fol=
lowing graph is the answer key.=C2=A0
