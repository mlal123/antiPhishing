Is there any way to do this problem other than finding the double partial d=
erivatives with respect to both x and y for every equation and adding them =
to see if they equal zero? That seems really time consuming... especially s=
ince if you get one wrong you don't know which one it is since WebAssign on=
ly tells you if you didn't check the right group of equations

Determine whether each of the following functions is a solution of Laplace'=
s equation=C2=A0uxx=C2=A0+=C2=A0uyy=C2=A0=3D 0. (Select all that apply.)
