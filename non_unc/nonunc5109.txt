To all the employees at Chipotle who haven't seen me around as much, espe=
cially the guy with the really great eyebrows =E2=80=94 you know who you =
are =E2=80=94 I have a confession.

I've been going to the Monterrey food truck at least twice a week for the=
 last three months. And they know my order there.

I never meant for it to become a thing. It just happened one night in Feb=
ruary, when I stopped by at 2 a.m. on a Saturday, and the guy taking my o=
rder caved and finally told me how they make the salsa verde on their fol=
dout table. I knew in that moment that there was something more here.

But Chipotle, don't worry: Monterrey has stopped doing the=C2=A0free ques=
o deal ( http://sable.madmimi.com/c/14086?id=3D953813.28603.1.c76530ae52a=
ab73daf80d0e3b2cbbd59 ) at their restaurant, so I'm sure you'll be gettin=
g back plenty of defectors. It's just that I won't be one of them.

I'll drop off a box of your things tomorrow after work.
