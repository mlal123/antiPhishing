This reading is optional, I just thought some of you may find this interest=
ing since you've recently learned about cryptographic hash functions.

Keep reading, who knows,=C2=A0maybe something you read will stop you from l=

From a stackexchange post:
MD5 for passwords
Using salted md5 for passwords is a bad idea. Not because of MD5's cryptogr=
aphic weaknesses, but because it's fast. This means that an attacker can tr=
y billions of candidate passwords per second on a single GPU.
What you should use are deliberately slow hash constructions, such as scryp=
t, bcrypt and PBKDF2. Simple salted SHA-2 is not good enough because, like =
most general purpose hashes, it's fast. Check out How to securely hash pass=
words? for details on what you should use.

MD5 for file integrity
Using MD5 for file integrity may or may not be a practical problem, dependi=
ng on your exact usage scenario.
The attacks against MD5 are collision attacks, not pre-image attacks. This =
means an attacker can produce two files with the same hash, if he has contr=
ol over both of them. But he can't match the hash of an existing file he di=
dn't influence.
I don't know if the attacks applies to your application, but personally I'd=
 start migrating even if you think it doesn't. It's far too easy to overloo=
k something. Better safe than sorry.
The best solution in this context is SHA-2 (SHA-256) for now. Once SHA-3 ge=
ts standardized it will be a good choice too.
I remember reading this for the first time and never had I imagined that an=
 encryption algorithm is not effective because it is fast. Just something t=
o think about....

Also interestingly enough, Yahoo (up to 2016 could still be today not exact=
ly sure) still used MD5 to hash its passwords... such a Yahoo move

Here is also an article I highly recommend reading from earlier this year w=
hen the first sha1 collision was discovered:=C2=A0https://security.googlebl=
og.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html

Basically, stop using sha1 and md5, also if you have a yahoo email account =
you should probably switch to another email service provider.
