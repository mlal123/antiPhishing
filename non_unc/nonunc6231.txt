Here's what has happened in COMP 550.02 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Gradescope Mark-Up  (9/11/17 10:03 PM)

The Gradescope settings for hw2 only give the option to upload a PDF. My PDF is four pages long, but the spaces for each answer are predetermined and all lie in the first page of the PDF. Please adjust the Gradescope settings so that in the future we may mark the space for each answer ourselves.
