Greetings Mangza Lal,

Congratulations on your completed application for the Resident Advisor 2017F-2018S at UNC Chapel Hill. We have reviewed all available components of your application including attending an information session, and have verified that you are in good standing with Student Conduct. We will verify cumulative GPAs at the beginning of the Spring 2017 semester. When we receive that report, we will update those candidates who do not meet the GPA requirement that they will not progress to the next stage of the process.

We would like to extend you an invitation to sign up for an individual interview! As reviewed during our RA Information Sessions, we will host Individual Interviews on _**Monday,**_ **_January 9th and Tuesday, January 10th_**in the_**Great Hall at the FPG Union**_. We will open our residence halls for candidates who live on-campus on Saturday, January 7th at 9am. You do not need to request special access to your community; we will have your flex pass activated.

To sign up for an interview, simply log-in to your eRezLife account and select an available time. Interviews are scheduled on a first come, first serve basis since there are no classes on either of those two interview days. _**Please make your travel plans accordingly (when a time slot fills, it will close). If you live local, we encourage you to sign up for the earliest available interview time**__**(it helps other candidates traveling from a distance).**_ If you are aware that you will not have a cumulative 2.5 GPA, please do not sign up for an interview at this time.

**Please note that individual interview sign ups will close at 10pm on Saturday, December 17, 2016.** _You will have the opportunity to change times up until Saturday, December 17, 2016 at 10PM provided that the time slot is available._

Please remember that individual interviews will last about 30 minutes for each candidate and the preferred dress is business casual. There is no need to bring additional copies of your resume as we have electronic copies saved with your application in eRezLife. Please plan to arrive about 5-10 minutes early for your interview. When you arrive, you will check in with some of our current staff who will be seated at tables outside the entrance to the Great Hall. When your interviewers (a professional staff member and a current RA) are ready to begin your interview, they will come and get you from the waiting area.

We wish you the best of luck in the process and look forward to speaking with you in a few weeks.

Sincerely,
