I don't understand what value WebAssign could be looking for to make fx and=
 fy both continuous - I would think that y just needs to be greater than 0 =
(which I tried and WebAssign marked as wrong), because in the expression=C2=
=A0$$\frac{1}{2sqrt(y+\cos^2x)}$$ you would just need y to be greater than =
0 so that the denominator can't possibly be 0. Am I missing something? I ca=
n't think of any other logic that makes sense
