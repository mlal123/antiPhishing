The marathon is the culmination of CFTK's year-long fundraising efforts,
which benefit the patients and families of UNC Children's Hospital. The
marathon is a 24 hour no-sleeping, no sitting event =E2=80=93 it is a Carol=
ina
tradition and a once in a lifetime experience! There is plenty to keep you
entertained throughout the marathon: food, performances, games, raves,
hedgehogs, bounce houses, a sunrise walk at Kenan stadium, visits from our
Kid Co-Captains and their families and much more.

Each participant in the marathon is expected to raise $200 by March
23-24th, 2018 and stand for 24 hours! If $200 seems like a lot, don't
