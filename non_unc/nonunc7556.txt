Two Notes: Sniffing and Spoofing

Thank you for the good questions. A correction on the assignment:

For task 2b.) You should only spoof an ICMP request from a valid IP other t=
han your own, to a live server (such as google.com). You do not have to see=
 a response from the server because the server's response is sent to the sp=
oofed source.
For Task 2c.) A python file should be submitted. Name it:
a5_onyen_etherspoof.py
Do not answer Question #3 because the answer depends on your network config=
uration in the VM. If you are interested learning more about promiscuous mo=
de, feel free to come in.

For the poster presentations, we've received some questions about technical=
 content. If your topic is related to a vulnerability, check it out on vuln=
ers.com and exploit-db.com Exploit-db is an open source database of exploit=
s along with the code which exploits it. It should give you=C2=A0the most t=
echnical information on how a vulnerability is exploited.=C2=A0
