The UNC Dance Marathon Through the Years

When student Michael Bucy created the UNC Dance Marathon in 1997, he had a
clear mission: "To unite the University, community and state in fostering
emotional and financial support that improves the quality of life for
patients and families of N.C. Children's Hospital."

Read about how Carolina For The Kids has stayed true to this goal through
the many years of the marathon, and also check out some seriously 90's
Carolina style.

=E2=80=9CMy first piece of advice would be to go for it. There are so many =

able to do it, but pushing yourself and being uncomfortable for just a
short period of time for the children and their families is so worth it.=E2=
