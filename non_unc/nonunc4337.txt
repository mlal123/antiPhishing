parallelogram confusion  (2/05/17 8:05 PM)

If a parallelogram has vertices A,B,C,D does that imply A is top left, B is=
 top right, C is bottom right, and D is bottom left? How do you tell where =
each vertice is? I keep getting problems wrong that require finding the are=
a of the parallelogram via the cross product so I'm thinking maybe I'm not =
subtracting the correct point from each other to create the necessary vecto=
rs.

Can someone explain why problem 1. The equation x2 =E2=88=92 8y2 + z2 =3D 1=
21 describes z as a function of x and y is false and x2 + 4z3 + y =3D 49 is=
 true?
