Your classmate posted a new Question.=20

Problem 3.4

Assume that source elements of length k are mapped in some uniform fashion =
into a target elements of length p. If each digit can take on one of r valu=
es, then the number of source elements is rk and the number of target eleme=
nts is the smaller number rp.
A particular source element xi is mapped to a particular target element yj.
a. What is the probability that the correct source element can be selected =
by an
adversary on one try?
b. What is the probability that a different source element xk (xi =3D=CC=B8=
 xk) that results in
the same target element, yj, could be produced by an adversary?
c. What is the probability that the correct target element can be produced =
by an
adversary on one try?
Could someone go over how to do this one?=C2=A0
