Mastering Biology Readiness Questions  (1/11/17 3:35 PM)

In Part A of the Readiness questions for the Introduction to MasteringBiology for Non-Majors it asks for the days homework assignments are due. In the syllabus it says Sundays and Thursdays; however, that was incorrect on MasteringBiology. After guessing the rest of the answers I finally got the question right by choosing Mondays and Wednesdays. I was just wondering which of these is correct and if credit will be taken off for this question because of the incorrect data across the two websites.
