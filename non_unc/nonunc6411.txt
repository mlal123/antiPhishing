Homework Assignment 2 - Submission Outline

Some of your Gradescope submissions for Homework 2 are not outlined correctly. Every question should be mapped to an image, or, if you are using a PDF, one or more pages in your uploaded PDF.

Please make sure that your solution follows the assignment outline by going on Gradescope, selecting your submission andn selecting 'Reselect Pages' in the bottom right of your screen. This should give you the option to re-assign pages of your PDF to each question in the assignment outline.

Thank you!
