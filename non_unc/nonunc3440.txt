Ray OH tommorrow...and soft assignment extension

Rays class got moved amd conflicts w OH tommorrow so now he will hold them 11 30 to 1 and then 5 to 6:30 this week only. And now for the news you guys care about more potentially. So I am going to pull sakai grades down Saturday evening or Sunday morning. At that point in time I will mark all assignments turned in at that time as on time. Dr.Stotts (if he has not already) will be sending you an email or will be making an official post in the near future. So if you turned in already and want to tune a few things up go ahead and feel through to submit through Friday and Saturday. Be sure to turn in the one you wish to be graded. That is to say don't just try to put "something" up there that doesn't really work instead of taking a late penalty on a now functioning but late program!
