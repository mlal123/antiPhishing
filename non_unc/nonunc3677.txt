RunTests not running properly

I have written my code and have tested it by hand with the given test cases and everything passes fine. However when I try to test through the oracle tests, the window never pops up and I'm just left with an icon on my dock that doesn't actually correspond with any window. Is anyone else having this problem and know how to fix it?
