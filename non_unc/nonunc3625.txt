Re: Labs not on Sakai

Will our earlier labs that are not on Sakai be up in the grade book soon? I ask because I want to know how I did before the exam takes place so that 1. I can know what I did wrong (if anything) and 2. To be able to contest anything that I may disagree with (again, if there is anything like that). Just wondering. Thank you! :)
