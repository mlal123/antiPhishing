Your classmate posted a new Question. 

GRQ Chart

In the chart on page 6 of the GRQ's, it has a column for "Where would you find it?" referring to the different mono-, di-, and polysaccharides. I am not sure exactly what this is referring to. Is it asking where we find these compounds in the human body or in other forms (like glucose and fructose in honey)?
