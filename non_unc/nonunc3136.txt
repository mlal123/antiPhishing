Zig Zig Implementation

Hello all,
I have done some research on splay trees, and most of the websites I have gone to say that zig zig is done by rotating the parent, and then rotating the node you intended to splay. However, on the visualization website, it does not appear to follow this pattern. Can anyone clarify this for me? Thank you!
