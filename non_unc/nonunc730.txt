Are we supposed to print only the "Unrecognized Option" if input is incorrect, or are we supposed to print "Unrecognized Option" and "please press 1 to hold, or press 2 to roll again" ?

importing GIT  (11/03/15 2:00 PM)

I understand that this is probably a very elementary question, but for some reason, whenever i trying to import the git it says this message on the last step:
"Some or all projects cannot be imported because they already exist in the workspace"

do i delete all my projects on the left panel?
