Here's what has happened in COMP 435 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Task 2.b Question  (12/03/17 8:59 PM)

This task says that if the spoofing is successful, we should see the echo r=
eply coming back from the remote machine on Wireshark.

However, since we are sending the echo request on behalf of another machine=
, shouldn't the echo reply from the remote machine be going to that machine=
 instead of ours meaning that we won't see the reply on Wireshark. Maybe so=
me clarification on what "another machine" is would help=C2=A0e.g. is it a =
different remote machine on the internet or a different machine in our netw=
ork?

A5 2.c  (12/03/17 8:35 PM)

At the end of Task2.c, it wrote.
"Set 01:02:03:04:05:06 as the source address. When using Scapy, set 1:02:03=
:04:05:06 as the =E2=80=9Dsrc=E2=80=9D field in the Ether() object."
Are these two sentences describing the same src?

Also, do we need to use a certain dst=C2=A0for 2.c ?

Scapy instructions?  (12/03/17 6:15 PM)

In assignment 5 it mentioned that it will intro a bit on scapy=C2=A0but not=
hing was actually said about it. And the website given about scapy=C2=A0off=
ers really limited description of functions and examples. Is there any othe=
