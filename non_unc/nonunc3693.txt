Struct not compiling

So basically, when I try to compile my code with just this:
struct point {
int x=CD=BE
int y=CD=BE
}=CD=BE
And my main method, it refuses to work. It says,
ex1.c:6:3: error: stray '\315' in program
   int x=CD=BE
   ^
ex1.c:6:3: error: stray '\276' in program
ex1.c:8:3: error: expected ':', ',', ';', '}' or '__attribute__' before 'in=
t'
   int y=CD=BE
   ^
ex1.c:8:3: error: stray '\315' in program
ex1.c:8:3: error: stray '\276' in program

Anyone know why I can't get this compile?
