Hi!

I hope your semester is going well so far! I wanted to let you know that
applications to be a committee member are open at carolinaftk.org/committee=
s.
Today is the LAST DAY to apply for a committee, apply online before 10pm!

Joining a committee is a great way to get more involved in CFTK, build your
resume, make new friends and make a difference in the lives of families at
UNC Children's Hospital! Every committee directly serves the patients and
families and gets access to volunteer opportunities at the hospital. There
are 14 different committees, so whatever your major, interest or passion is
there is a committee for you! You can learn more about our committees here
.

But don't just take my word for it that CFTK is awesome, visit our testimon=
ials
page  to read stories from
other students about their experience with CFTK and why you should get
involved.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reply to this email or
find us in the Pit today from 10-2pm. Additionally, if you have not been
receiving CFTK emails, check your spam/clutter as we sent out an newsletter
on Monday! We are so excited for the year to come (our 20th Anniversary!)
and can't wait to make this year bigger and better. We hope to see you soon=
