Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Lab4 Ex5  (9/29/16 12:10 AM)

For the input in Ex5in2 :
00506098008+002+009000

My program works until it hits "09" and then it acts like the input was a "=
0" and prints "01 =3D 1" and terminates. =C2=A0Does anyone know why this wo=
uld do that? It's odd because it works for 005 and 06 but when I try 08 or =
09, my program terminates with "0! =3D 1".
