Efficiently checking for uniqueness of edge ID

I can't think of a particularly efficient way to check to see if an edge ID has already been used without creating some additional data structure. The best approach that I can think of is to iterate through the lists of edges, searching to see if I can find the ID. This would be O(E), which doesn't seem that great to me. Can anyone suggest how I might improve the running time of this search without significantly increasing the used memory? Or, like Max said in the "Node ID" question, do I not need to worry about duplicate IDs being passed in?
