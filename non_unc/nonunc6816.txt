ATTENTION: UNC Students, Faculty and Staff: 
 
A student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has tested positive for active tuberculosis (TB) which is a disease that generally develops over weeks and months and is completely curable with medications. The student is no longer on campus and has submitted to home isolation. A small number of individuals may have previously been exposed to this student. The University is working closely with the Orange County Health Department to contact these individuals and to ensure that they receive appropriate testing and, if necessary, treatment. You are only at risk if you have come in contact with someone who has TB. 
 
If you have any questions or concerns regarding your potential exposure please contact Campus Health Services at (919) 966-6573 or University Employee Occupational Health Clinic (919) 966-9119.
