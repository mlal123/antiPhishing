How to create a JAR file?  (1/21/16 9:15 PM)

I'm trying to submit the programs on the autograder but I'm having problems making a JAR file to submit. I tried clicking on the directory and using the export option but I can't find any option to export files into a JAR file. Can I get a little help on this? Thank you!

So... not sure if you all knew this, but one of your your TAs, David, worked on the movie Wreck-it Ralph (along with a few other awesome movies you know) ! I haven't told him about this post, so feel free to go freak him out with your new-found knowledge!
