HW 13.1 #7 - Canzani

13.1_7.docx

I watched the video for the problem and I got everything until he turned everything into parametric equations.

He would set X=t and since we figured out Y, we would plug in "t" for the "x" values and then set Z to either of the two equations.

How and why did the video set it into parametric equations?

The parametric equations I think of is in the form, X = x_0 + a*t

I got up to y = (x^2-16)/2
