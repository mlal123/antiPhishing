Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:

The University will TEST the emergency sirens and messaging system on Thursday, June 23, between noon and 1 p. m. This test is part of a verification process to ensure newly installed equipment and software are working properly. These upgrades will help accelerate the alert procedures and will reduce the potential for human error by automating several notification and communication processes.

No action is required during this test.

During the test, anyone outdoors on or near campus will most likely hear the sirens. However, the sirens are not designed to be heard inside or while you are in a vehicle. The sirens will sound an alert tone along with a brief pre-recorded voice message. When testing is complete, a different siren tone and voice message will signal "All clear. Resume regular activities."

The University also sends a text message to cell phone users who registered their numbers in the online campus directory. In an emergency, the University will post safety-related announcements on the Alert Carolina System website, alertcarolina.unc.edu, along with updates.

As a reminder, the sirens sound only for a major emergency or an immediate safety or health threat such as:

* An armed and dangerous person on or near campus;
* A major fire or hazardous material incident;
* A tornado warning for the Chapel Hill-Carrboro area issued by the National Weather Service; or
* A different emergency requiring immediate notification as determined by the Department of Public Safety.

The sirens are part of the University's emergency notification system, Alert Carolina. The University follows Emergency Notification Protocols when informing the campus community using four types of notifications - Emergency Warning (sirens), Timely Warning, Informational Messages and Adverse Weather Messages.
