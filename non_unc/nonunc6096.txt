Here's what has happened in COMP 550.02 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Gradescope Multiple-PDF Submission  (9/05/17 7:14 PM)

Gradescope won't let me submit images, and it won't let me submit more than one PDF. My solution spanned two pages, so they were two images, and became two PDFs, but I can't submit them because of Gradescope. Does anyone have any suggestions?
