ring in more cash =E2=86=92 (https://www.buzzfeed.com/janelytvynenko/fake-=
news-in-instant-articles)
=E2=80=9CBuzzFeed News found 29 Facebook pages=2C and associated websites=
=2C that are using Instant Articles to help their completely false stories=
 load faster on Facebook. At least 24 of these pages are also signed up wi=
th Facebook Audience Network=2C meaning Facebook itself earns a share of r=

=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re used to a world where if you put something out ther=

 =E2=86=92 (https://fashionista.com/2018/02/choire-sicha-nyt-styles-editor=

=E2=80=9CThe number one struggle in media is we have to begin to address d=
ifferent audiences separately and I think Styles=2C more than many other p=
laces=2C feels that pressure. Beauty writers know. Beauty writers have to=
 write for people with different skin and different ethnicities and differ=

A crazy idea for funding local news: Charge people for it =E2=86=92 (https=

=E2=80=9CThe evidence we=E2=80=99ve collected shows a highly engaged and f=

=E2=80=9CThe iPad is a fine platform on which to consume media. But it was=

=E2=80=9CThe larger problem for BuzzFeed=2C by extension=2C is that if new=
s isn=E2=80=99t making enough money to fund itself despite the company=E2=
=80=99s best efforts to integrate with Facebook and other platforms=2C and=
 if Facebook intends to further decrease the presence of news in the strea=
ms of users=2C how does BuzzFeed justify continuing to invest in it? An ac=
