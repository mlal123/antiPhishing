#5 on 12.2-Vectors and Geometry of Space WebAssign - Etheridge MWF 11:15 am=
 -12:05 pm

There doesn't seem to be a correct answer choice available for this questio=
n. One of the answer choices has the correct sum vector, but an incorrect a=
=C2=A0vector (pointing in the wrong direction), whereas another answer choi=
ce has the correct a and b vectors but with an incorrect sum vector (pointi=
ng in the wrong direction).=C2=A0

Unless I'm doing something incorrectly? I went with the one with the correc=
t sum vector, but WebAssign marked it wrong.=C2=A0

=C2=A0
