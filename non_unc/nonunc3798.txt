TA/LA Evaluations

Hey guys. If any of you wish to fill out a quick survey I whipped up on how you think individual TA/LAs did this semester that would be great!

You will make one response per TA/LA eval. So feel free to do this for each TA/LA if you have had a positive, negative, or mixed interaction with any of us!
Since organizing a class of this volume while trying to continue to be a personable teaching staff is quite a challenge, so evaluations like this are great to help us gauge how we are doing.
Good luck on the rest of finals!

Just a note: Hao and I are the graduate TAs for the course, while everyone else is an undergrad LA. I notice that I did not make this distinction in the survey (though I'm not sure if it matters all too much). Thanks!
