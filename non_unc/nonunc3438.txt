Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Late turn in  (11/10/16 5:12 PM)

How does point deduction for late assignments work? Is it 10% for every 24 hours?

------------------------------------------------------------
Topo Sort null case  (11/10/16 7:36 PM)

I added an edge that connects two vertices, except that one of the vertices is non-existant, would the topo sort return a false or just run the sort on the valid graph?
