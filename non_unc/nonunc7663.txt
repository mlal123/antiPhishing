Toposort possible error in review session slides?  (12/05/17 4:50 PM)

I was looking at the review session slides (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EkMRW1DWFsyqMkdKvxw4037-l7c4HFIl0MBzvChWYqU/edit#slide=id.g29c1450f23_0_1947) and worked out the topo sort (slide 52) and I got a different order. Since I used a stack, A connects to D, H, and J so their "order" is A(1,12), D(6,7), H(8,9), J(10,11). The rest is the same. Am I wrong or are the slides wrong? The reverse DFS order I get is C F I G A J H D B E.
