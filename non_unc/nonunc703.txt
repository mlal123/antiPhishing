I understand how to call the roll method in RollResult to roll the dice, but how do we then use the two Boolean methods? Not sure how to go about it.

Pig: Holding test  (11/02/15 2:15 AM)

I can't make the holding test work at all. I'm trying to use keyboard.nextInt()==# for conditionals and whiles to test for the input, but it makes a java error/exception if I use more than one keyboard.nextInt(). I have no clue what I'm supposed to do.
