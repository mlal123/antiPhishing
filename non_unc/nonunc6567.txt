Hw Question #4

I'm a little confused on how you would break this problem up into paths. Does B(x,y) tell us if we are inside or outside of the boundary? Wouldn't that be the key thing we need to know? What would we use things like the center point for? I understand what we are supposed to do and what we are given, I guess I'm just confused on determining the conditions in which we step in, out or forward. (I'd ask this in office hours as it's a mouthful, but I just figured out I have a fever).
