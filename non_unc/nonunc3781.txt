Greetings Mangza Lal,

 Thank you for your interest in the Resident Advisor 2017F-2018S role at UNC Chapel Hill. It has come to our attention that you have not yet had the necessary reference submitted on your behalf. In order to move forward in our process we must have one completed reference on file to review with your application. Please make sure to ask your reference to check any spam/trash filters they may have set up and to look for an auto-generated email from "eRezLife Software System or noreply@erezlife.com" with the subject line of "reference notification." If you believe you may have entered their email incorrectly or they need the notification re-sent, please contact me at allave@email.unc.edu by 3:00pm on Dec 09, 2016.

Sincerely,
