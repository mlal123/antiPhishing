Good morning and happy Thursday!
In an unusual turn of events, I have recently made headlines myself. My h=
igh school newspaper decided to run an article on students who had their =
parents as teachers while they were in school. That's right =E2=80=94 I w=
as one of those lucky teenagers that got to have their parents' watchful =
eye on them both at home and in the classroom. =

My mother did not only teach at my high school. She also taught at my mid=
dle school. While most adolescents would slouch while giving a pesky side=
-eye at the idea of having their mom in their school, I can honestly say =
the two of us greatly enjoyed it. We were kind of like a Gilmore Girls/Th=
e Wonder Twins crossover episode. Plus, not many students can say they've=
 seen their teachers gossiping over wine on their front porch.
Teachers made headlines in a different way yesterday with the March for S=
tudents and Rally for Respect held in Raleigh by the N.C. Association of =
Educators over teacher pay and resources. =
