Data Science Graduate Student Research Assistantship
*Ap=
plication
due Friday, July 7th, by 5:00 P.M.*

The Odum Institute for Research in Social Science at UNC is seeking
applications for a graduate student research assistant for the 2017-18
academic year in the area of data science. This program is part of the
Institute=E2=80=99s collaboration with the *Data@Carolina*

initiative and is supported by the College of Arts and Sciences and the UNC
Graduate College.

The stipend will be paid by the Institute and will be equal to the
student=E2=80=99s normal departmental stipend or $16,700 =E2=80=93 whicheve=
r amount is
greater. The student will receive the stipend in lieu of their normal TA or
RA departmental assignment. Tuition and insurance will be covered as is
normal.

There is no specific requirement regarding the content of the application,
and we encourage creative applications. We define data science broadly.
Possible topics might include, but are not limited to: 1) methodological
research on identifying, collecting, and/or analyzing diverse types of
data, 2) applications of data science tools/methods to substantive topics,
or 3) data sharing, research transparency, or other aspects of open
science. We plan to select a student whose own research and professional
development will benefit from working with members of the Odum Institute
staff. This could include collaboration on research, publications, grant
proposals, and presenting data science workshops relevant to the selected
student=E2=80=99s research interests and skills.

*Eligibility:* This program is open to graduate students in good standing
pursuing a PhD within any department that is part of the College of Arts
and Sciences at UNC. Strong preference will be given to students working in
the social and behavioral sciences.
How to Apply: Applications should include: 1) a cover letter describing the
student=E2=80=99s research interests and relevant skills (limited to two pa=
ges,
single-spaced, 12-point font), 2) the student=E2=80=99s CV, and 3) a letter=
 of
recommendation from the student=E2=80=99s advisor. Materials should be emai=

Tom Carsey (carsey@unc.edu) with the subject line "Odum Data Science RA
Application." *Applications must be received by Friday, July 7 by 5:00 P.M.=
