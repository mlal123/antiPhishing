The University will not send additional text, email or other notifications to the campus community about a severe thunderstorm warning since the status of those often change frequently during a weather event. If a new weather pattern enters the area that prompts a fresh alert after a 24-hour period, the University plans to reissue the notice as part of ongoing monitoring efforts for potential serious weather conditions.

If the weather service issues a tornado watch for Orange County, the University will issue a separate notification. If the weather service issues a tornado warning for Chapel Hill and Carrboro, the University will activate the emergency sirens. A tornado warning means that a tornado has been spotted, or that radar indicates a thunderstorm circulation that can spawn a tornado, according to the National Weather Service. The University will activate the sirens for a significant emergency or immediate health or safety threat, send a text message to registered cell phones and start other notifications including campus email.

ABOUT THIS EMAIL:  Campus-wide email is not an instant source of information as part of the University's Alert Carolina System notification process.The University's Alert Carolina System is activated using a strategy that is based on redundancy, using multiple methods to communicate. The best, most up-to-date source of information will always be the Alert Carolina website, https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3a%2f%2falertcarolina.unc.edu&data=01%7c01%7cmlal123%40live.unc.edu%7c2132bebdeaf348f968d908d3b9a08a6d%7c58b3d54f16c942d3af081fcabd095666%7c1&sdata=oA0UuvLdJo2BuEy63xNmgJ1YCRWVJSRHKoSLvyTFH9A%3d.
