Venue Entry Information: You must present the credit card used to make the purchase along with your student ID at the designated student entry gate on the North West side of the venue. At the gate, a guest service representative will scan your credit card and validate your Student ID. You will receive a seat locator and wrist band. Your reserved seat is only valid for the game in which your team is participating. If you would like to attend both games, you will be directed to a secondary seating location for the game that your team is not participating in.

Students of advancing teams will have tickets for the National Championship placed automatically into their existing account at no additional charge. If UNC does not advance you will not receive or be charged for a ticket to the Championship game on Monday.
