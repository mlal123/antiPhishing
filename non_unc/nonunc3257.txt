how to access a product  (10/28/16 1:30 PM)

so I know that after using mult, the the higher and lower parts of the product are stored in HI and LO. And to access them we use mfhi and mflo function. But if I want to use the product later on, do I just add the HI and LO? Basically, how do I put the 2 parts of the result back into one register so I can use it later on? Thanks!
