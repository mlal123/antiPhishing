Troubles with ColorPlayground  (11/10/15 11:59 PM)

Hey,

I was wondering if anyone else was having trouble getting the ColorPlaygrou=
nd window to display a color in the latest assignment? My Color class is pa=
ssing all of the tests defined in=C2=A0ColorSemanticsTests and=C2=A0ColorDe=
finitionTests,=C2=A0and yet, when I uncomment the lines of code to display =
the ColorPlayground window, the background color of the window does not cha=
nge. I have attached a picture of this behavior below.
