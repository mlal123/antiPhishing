B1 Help  (11/27/17 3:39 PM)

I am confused as to why this is not working. I am referencing the mongodb docs.

b1 = [db.prizes.find({"year":{$lt:2000}})]Why is it saying there's a syntax error at the $lt?

In-Class Exercise  (11/27/17 3:29 PM)

The first question says "transform it into canonical form then standard form" - but in the book, both slack and standard forms are types of canonical form. So I'm confused on what the prof wants us to do for "canonical form". 

For the question, should canonical be the transformed objective function and constraints, and standard form include slack variables?
