I cannot manage to send a packet correctly when using sendp. if I literally copy the code from the documentation that Connor linked, it gives me errors, I've tried changing the interface, and just cant find anything about this. Is there something I need to be doing thats different from what is in the documentation.

Is it ok that all of my python files give the warning "N route found for IPv6 destination :: (no default route?)
