Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Size of heap  (10/02/16 5:58 PM)

=C2=A0 MinBinHeap mbh=3D new MinBinHeap();    EntryPair[] collection=3D new=
 EntryPair[8];

Assuming that I don't add anything to the slots of the collection, should t=
he size be 8 (being filled with 8 nulls)? Or should the size be 0?
