Mangza, 

We've received several frantic phone calls from invitees and their families at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill regarding NSCS invitations that have arrived late to their homes this past week. This mailing delay was caused by the snowstorms across the Northeast that affected mail transportation and delivery. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that this delay caused you in accepting the invitation. That's why we are offering you a short extension on your invitation acceptance deadline. If you would like to accept your invitation to NSCS, please do so by your extended deadline of February 24.
