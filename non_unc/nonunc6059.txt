Here's what has happened in COMP 435 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Install PyCharm on Ubuntu VM  (9/03/17 6:35 PM)

Hey all, trying to install PyCharm on the VM, got everything ready to go but when I run the program in terminal it informs me that PyCharm cannot start because it requires Java 1.8 or higher, while the version this VM is bundled with is 1.6 something. Can we update the JRE running in the VM, or will we be looking at any exploits that are related to the certain installed version?
