Communication: Articulate thoughts and ideas
clearly and effectively in written and oral forms to persons inside and out=
side
of

the organization. The individual has public speaking skills;
is able to express ideas to others; and can write/edit memos, letters, and
complex technical reports clearly and effectively.

Communication on all levels is occurring around you at all
times. Communication facilitates human connection and provides us with the
opportunity to learn, grow and progress. It=E2=80=99s not just about speaki=
ng, reading
and texting, but understanding what is being said and in many cases, what is
not being said. Take this opportunity to do a check-in  with yourself. Are
you a good communicator? Are you a good listener? Could you improve in any
areas of your communication?

The great news is that communication is a skill that you can
grow and improve on all levels if you are willing to put in the time, effort
and energy. You should want to do this! Communication skills are necessary =
in
the world of work, no matter what path you take or destination you hope to
land.=20
