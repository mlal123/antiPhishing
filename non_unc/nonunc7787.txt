 Dear Professor:

The Pearson Sociology Team is hard at work on exciting new materials for the Marriage & Family course and the Social Problems course. 
 
If you teach Marriage & Family and/or Social Problems, we would love to learn more about your course(s), how you teach the class, and the materials you use. We hope that you can participate in a very brief survey that should take no more than 10 minutes of your time.
 
The Marriage and Family survey can be accessed by clicking here:
