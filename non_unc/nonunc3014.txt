Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

Pointers  (10/10/16 11:48 PM)

I am having a bit of trouble understanding the syntax of a pointer and what=
 we can and can't do. When we define a pointer as "int *p" but then we say =
p =3D &i (assuming i is some variable defined somewhere in memory) does p =
=3D the dereferenced i (because p was defined as a pointer) or is *p =3D to=
 the dereferenced i and p =3D the address of i?=C2=A0

Sorry if this is a confusing question. I can clear parts of it up of someth=
ing is unclear.=C2=A0

Is lecture 8 on the exam  (10/11/16 1:52 AM)

So I know transistors are not included in the midterm. Does the content in =
lecture 8 included, since it's not about transistors?

Quizlets!  (10/11/16 3:23 AM)

Depending on what class you're in, there's 12+ hours left to study! As we k=
now, sleep is for the weak (or better prepared...), so I present to you my =
set of Quizlets I made for this exam. Definitions are exact quotes from lec=
tures or the textbook, wherever possible. I did include some stuff on trans=
istors, so if you think that won't be on the exam, then of course don't swe=
at it too much. Additionally, there are no formulas, equations, etc. on her=
e or basically anything that I assumed most people would put on their cheat=
 sheet and thus would not need to memorize, etc.

Basics (Ch. 1 textbook; what is a silicon wafer, what is throughput, etc.)
Representation + Other (Ch. 2 mostly; how do we encode information; von Neu=
mann computers; C (de)referencing; etc.)
MIPS (what is MIPS; how do its instructions work; operand / instruction for=
mat types; etc.)
Transistors (what is a digital system; parallel vs. series circuits; combin=
ational vs. sequential; etc.)
All (combination of all of the above, i.e. no new flash cards included here=
, just for convenience)
