Members of the Carolina Community,

We are writing to share the sad news of the death of a resident of Hinton James Residence Hall.   We ask that you join us in keeping this student's family and friends in your thoughts and prayers.  

The situation is under police investigation and the information we can share is limited.   However, it is important to know that no suspicious circumstances are reported and at no time was there danger to the Hinton James or greater campus community. 

Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) staff members are available to assist students who may wish to speak with someone.  Support is available through CAPS by calling (919) 966-2281 (during non-office hours) or by walk-in at the CAPS offices (3rd Floor of Campus Health) from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. 

In addition, residents in Hinton James are also encouraged to contact your Resident Advisor or Community Director, stop by the Front Desk, or call the Duty Cell Phone (919) 962-7611 should you need assistance. 

Sincerely,
