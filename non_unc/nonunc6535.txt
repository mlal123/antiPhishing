Here's what has happened in COMP 435 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 2 part 3.4 questions  (9/29/17 3:27 PM)

The first questions asks about the average number of comparisons needed to =
find 2 matches. If we are generating strings iteratively than our code will=
 make the same number of comparisons every time it is run. The programming =
problem did not put any constraints on the method to generate our strings t=
o compare, so should we just put down the number of comparisons needed or d=
o we need to code in randomness in generating our strings? It seems to me t=
hat an iterative approach would be better for efficiency as you do not need=
 to worry about duplicate strings generated.=C2=A0

Assignment 2 Part 3.3 (4a)  (9/29/17 1:09 PM)

The assignment says we should be able to run your program as python3 a2_ony=
en_preimage.py hashvalue. Farther down in the guidelines, it says we should=
 be able to run the program as python3 a2_onyen_preimage.py input.txt.

Which input should we be using? A direct hash value or a file that contains=
 a hash value?=C2=A0
