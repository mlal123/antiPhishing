What you need to know:

	- The University of North Carolina System requires eligible students to have health insurance.
	- You will automatically be enrolled in, and billed for, Student Blue coverage unless you waive coverage by September 10. If you have your own plan, make sure you waive Student Blue coverage by that date.
	- Want to enroll in Student Blue coverage for Fall 2015? Enroll no later than September 10, in order to receive timely ID cards. Students enrolled by default will not receive ID cards until after the deadline.
	- Already covered under another Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina plan and want to keep it? You'll still need to waive the Student Blue coverage each university semester, or you will be charged for it.
