Your classmate posted a new Question. 

will there be probabilistic analysis on the exam or not?

the list of required topics to know on the exam doesn't seem to include probability analysis, and upon the announcement of the midterm, there wasn't any indication that probability would be on the midterm at all. 
however, there's a couple of probability questions that aren't starred in the practice exam, aka indicating that they might be included on the midterm this thursday. so will there be or won't there be?
