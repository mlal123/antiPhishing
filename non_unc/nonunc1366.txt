Discrepancy in "intensity"  (2/01/16 3:58 PM)

For the GrayPixel=C2=A0class, we are told to input a double value "intensit=
y" as a parameter in the constructor. However, we are also given a formula =
to calculate intensity (intensity =3D 0.299 * red + 0.587 * green + 0.114 *=
 blue). In the getIntensity method for the GrayPixel class, I was wondering=
 if we simply return the instance variable intensity for a gray pixel or if=
 we use this=C2=A0formula to calculate the intensity of the gray pixel.=C2=
=A0

A3 and Interfaces  (2/01/16 4:55 PM)

I am still a little confused by interfaces, do you define the method in the=
 interface itself or just list the methods and define them in a different c=

Thanks!

A2 Jedi Vertcal Printing  (2/01/16 6:29 PM)

Hello,
I am working on A2 Jedi and cannot seem to figure out a way to print everyt=
hing vertically. I know that it does not actually print vertically, but hor=
izontally as to appear vertical. I've thought of creating arrays of strings=
 that contain asterisks and spaces, but I have not gotten far with this way=
 of thinking. Any helpful hints would be appreciated. Thank you!
