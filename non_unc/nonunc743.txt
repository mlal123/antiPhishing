Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

Getting rid of double printed winner name  (11/04/15 5:04 PM)


I cannot find where the double printed name is coming from in the program. Are there any suggestions and also would it matter in the grading?

holding method: I have to press 2 twice or the unrecognized option twice  (11/04/15 5:15 PM)

Is it ok if I have to press 2 or the unrecognized option twice for it to work? My holding test failed but the game works fine.

Instructions??  (11/04/15 7:09 PM)

I do not understand the instructions for assignment 3. They are barely in complete sentences. How does one even start? Do you need to completely change the method public roll(), or do you simply add to that? Also, how do you even go about editing the die.java? This assignment is not very clear.

GameOver  (11/04/15 8:28 PM)

In the GameOver section, do you have to call upon the Player class and its methods? Or is this section simply if-else statements of score1 and score2? Maybe I'm completely on the wrong track here...
