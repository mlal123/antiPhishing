=E2=80=9CWe want to see a whole lot more people prepared to answer those q=
uestions and help newsrooms do a better job of communicating (and storing=

=E2=80=9CPage previews pave a path for another way to interact with Wikipe=

How GDPR will change Facebook=E2=80=99s ad targeting =E2=86=92 (https://di=

=E2=80=9CThe social platform is in the challenging position of being class=

 collect information from users directly from mobile ads on Facebook=2C bo=
th Facebook and the businesses that use that tool are data controllers=2C=

cebook matches an advertiser=E2=80=99s customer-relationship management da=
