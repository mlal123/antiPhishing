Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
A4 BST should be SPLT  (10/10/16 7:49 PM)

The BST class provided in the write up should be called SPLT correct

------------------------------------------------------------
A4 editing return types  (10/10/16 8:02 PM)

So will we be required to rewrite our insert and remove=C2=A0of our BST cod=
e in SPLT since they use different return types? those being boolean and vo=
id. I'm a little confused as to that as I thought the point was to just wri=
te splay and not have to worry about changing BST, Even the BST code provid=
ed uses booleans for those methods. Thanks
