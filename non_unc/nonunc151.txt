Opening Eclipse Issues

Hi! My name is Dana Elhertani and I am one of your TA's for this class!

I've only been in lab for 30 minutes and I've noticed a lot of people are h=
aving the same issue when it comes to opening their eclipse. If you are a m=
ac user and the message "JAVA's version is 1.6.0_65 of the JVM is not suita=
ble for this product. Version 1.7 or greater is required." or If your a PC =
user and a long message comes up, you most likely have the same issue.=C2=
=A0

Go to=C2=A0http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-dow=
nloads-2133151.html
Then accept the license agreement, and download the link correlated to MAC =
OS X x64 or Windows x64 or whatever laptop you're using.
Try that. That seems to work for most people.
