CMOS NOR gate

I was looking at the implementation of a CMOS NOR gate and saw that it requ=
ired 3 pmos in series for the top & 3 nmos in parallel for the bottom. Can =
someone explain why the bottom has to be in parallel? I get that it has to =
be in series for the top, but if it is like that, won't the=C2=A0current ge=
t "stuck" at the top and not even be able t ground, so it doesn't=C2=A0matt=
er if the pull down section is in series=C2=A0or parallel?
