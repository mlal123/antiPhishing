I am confused about how to print B, C and D?

Part 3 =E2=80=93 First Decision
Use the scanner to allow the user to input an integer after Intro and A are=
 printed.=C2=A0One=C2=A0of three actions will then happen:If the user typed=
 1, print B, C and D (later we=E2=80=99ll refine this).=C2=A0If, instead, t=
he user typed 2, print E, F, and G (also refined later).=C2=A0Otherwise, pr=
int H, I, and J (later we=E2=80=99ll refine this too).

I have created my scanner and then put my keyboard nextInt line in, but aft=
er that I am not sure what to type in the System.out.println() to make it s=
o that it prints B, C and D

Also, do we put all of this part of the code into the parenthesis after Sto=
