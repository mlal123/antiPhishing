running the code issue  (8/25/15 10:56 PM)

i am trying to run my code that we did in class, but it keeps saying that I=
 need to select to run either "ant build" or "Ant build..."? =C2=A0Also, wh=
en i write the=C2=A0code System.out.println("Hello World"); the "out"=C2=A0=
isn't italicizing like Dr. Aikat's did in class. I want to come to lab/offi=
ce hours but my classes/extracurriculars override all of the times, so this=
 is my only option for now. Any ideas on how I=C2=A0can successfully run my=
 code without this error message popping up?=C2=A0
