Although it seems there is a different holiday being celebrated every day=
, there are only 10 national holidays recognized by the United States fed=
eral government. Holly McGuire, a senior editor at Chase=E2=80=99s Calend=
ar of Events, said it is more accurate to refer to these celebrations as =
national days.

In 1958, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce gave Chase's the authority to regis=
ter national holidays. Chase's is an almanac for information like holiday=
s, special events and historical anniversaries, and anyone can submit a s=
uggestion for a national day.

McGuire said there are not strict criteria in order to establish a nation=
al day with Chase=E2=80=99s, but there are several aspects the company lo=
oks for.

It is important that the person suggesting the holiday has a plan, has de=
monstrated commitment and has a reason for establishing the day, she said=
. For example, if it is a medical day, Chase's prefers that the appropria=
te nonprofit organization sponsor or be in support of it.
