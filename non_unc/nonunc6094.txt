Your classmate posted a new Question.=20

Proper formatting of hexadecimal output

The assignment mentions the following:=C2=A0

Your program should parse through the entire file and if there are more tha=
n 2 duplicates,
print out how many instances occurred. In this case the correct output will=
 be:
2 2
aa 2
123 3
9ec4c12949a4f31474f299058ce2b22a 2

The assignment mentions that the following should be outputted. However, '0=
2' is one of the inputs but '2' is outputted without a leading zero as the =
output. Should this format be followed or would it be fine to output '02' f=
ollowed by the number of times it was duplicated?=C2=A0
