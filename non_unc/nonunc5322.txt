Your classmate posted a new Question.=20

Dot Product angle vs Cross product angle

We have the theorems:
=C2=A0
a X b =3D |a||b|sin(angle)

a . b =3D |a||b| cos(angle)

So, when do I use them? If I am given an angle with the lengths of=C2=A0a=
=C2=A0and=C2=A0b, does it matter which rule I use?
