Remove: creating the left and right subtrees

Hey all,

I'm struggling with defining the L=C2=A0and R=C2=A0subtrees that I must cre=
ate in the remove method.

In remove, after I call contains, I understand that I must make separate sp=
lay trees out of the left and right subtrees, then call findMax on L, then =
join L and R.

How can I define these subtrees with what I know of a BST and SPLT? I hoped=
 to use variables=C2=A0left=C2=A0and=C2=A0right=C2=A0but these are BST_Node=
s. Not sure what else to do??

Thank you for your help!!
