5.1 Errors  (11/16/15 11:32 AM)

Based on the information from the class slides about using nested for-loops for 2-D arrays, I've tried to use them to fill the pixels array, but I keep getting errors. Any advice?

com.comp110.instagram package  (11/16/15 1:08 PM)

The assignment 4 submission instruction says to
"Right click on the com.comp110.instagram package. ** Not Assignment4. ** then Select Export"

isn't the com.comp110.instagram package in the Assignment4 files?
when I clicked on the package com.comp110.instagram in my program, there was no Export option.
