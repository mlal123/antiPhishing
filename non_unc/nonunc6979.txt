Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Master Theorem

How do you know whether you need to use the full or simplified master theorem? I did some of the master theorem exercises from the powerpoint with the full master theorem rules and I got the correct answers even though the powerpoint solutions used the simplified master theorem rules.
