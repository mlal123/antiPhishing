Hello, my name is Eric Trexler. =C2=A0I am a doctoral student in the EXSS D=
epartment, and I am currently recruiting participants for a research study,=
 entitled =E2=80=9CThe acute and chronic influence of a botanical supplemen=
t on muscle function and lean body mass.=E2=80=9D
=C2=A0
We are looking for healthy, recreationally active men between the ages of 1=
8-35. To qualify for this study, you must be a non-smoker who exercises 1-4=
 hours per week, with no more than 1 hour per week of resistance training. =
In addition, you must not be using supplements or prescription drugs that m=
ay influence performance. The purpose of this study is to determine if acut=
e supplementation with a botanical extract of=C2=A0Rhaponticum carthamoides=
=C2=A0and=C2=A0Rhodiola rosea=C2=A0influences leg strength or muscular endu=
rance.
=C2=A0
As a participant, you will be required to sign an informed consent document=
 stating you understand all of the procedures and rights as a research subj=
ect, and to fill out questionnaires regarding your health, diet, and physic=

g visits over the course of 10 weeks. Your first visit will involve filling=
 out some paperwork, body composition testing via DEXA, a blood draw, and f=
amiliarization for bench press and leg press. At the second visit, you=E2=

g program, which will include bench press, leg press, and leg extension, pe=
rformed three days per week. Throughout the program, you will take a supple=
ment that will either be a full dose of the test supplement, a half dose, o=
r a placebo. Strength testing will be repeated midway through the training =
program, and all tests will be repeated following the end of the program. T=
esting and training will take place in the Neuromuscular Research Laborator=
y, Applied Physiology Laboratory, and Human Performance center, which are a=
ll located in Fetzer Hall.
=C2=A0
Participants can receive up to $250 in compensation, along with free body c=
omposition testing and 8 weeks of free personal training. If you are intere=
