Small mistake in Local Checks jar

Hey guys. One of you made a good catch on the test cases. In size test 4, the test dump says:
4. GetMin doesn't Change Size:insert(<"a", 3>)getMin()insert(<"b", 2>)getMin()insert(<"c", 1>)delMin()getMin()size() == 2

However, I accidentally inserted c,3 instead of c,1.
We do not ask that you handle dups, so this is not a good test. Modified the actual test to reflect the test dump.
Please re-download the jar in the assignment page to use the most up to date suite. Apologies.
