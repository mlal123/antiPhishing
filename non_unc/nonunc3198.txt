sge MIPS error

Hello all,
I have run into a strange issue while finishing lab7. The sge instruction is not working properly. I have run through my code step-by-step, and have uncovered the following:

$s2 = 0
$t0 = 1
sge $t1, $s2, $t0 --> $t1=1

I may be missing something small, but shouldn't sge be setting $t1=0 since 0 is not greater than or equal to 1? Thanks!
