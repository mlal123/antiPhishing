Hello RA Candidates,

I hope that you all had a relaxing break and I am eager for the spring semester to begin! I wanted to give you an update on interviews as we are closely watching the weather. As you may be aware, our residence halls will NOT be opening early. We will open as scheduled at 9am on Saturday, January 7, 2017. We will be hosting our interviews only if the University is under normal conditions or weather condition 1 (this announcement is made via Alert Carolina). If you will not be able to safely travel to campus for your interview time, please email LaVel Heintz and we will figure out how to reschedule you for a Tuesday time slot or at later date. Your safety is our number one priority.

If the University falls under weather condition 2, we will cancel all interviews and reschedule for a later time. We will most likely use our back up dates of January 21st and /or January 22nd, but we will be in contact with more details.

Happy New Year,
