Looking at prof Fuchs' slides I really don't understand ppt. 6b slide 5, wh=
ich we just covered last class. I guess I understand the things in the yell=
ow box, but what does everything else really mean? if someone could give a =
brief explanation I would appreciate it thanks

Lab 4 ex5 appending to same line  (9/27/16 8:37 PM)

So the output of our program should look like Enter a number: !(number) =3D=
 (factorial), right?

How can I go about printing "Enter a number:", then scanning, then appendin=
g the "=C2=A0!(number) =3D (factorial)" to the same line?? I am only able t=
o make it look like this as of now.=C2=A0

Enter a number: //the user of course enters whatever number they want here
!(number) =3D (factorial)

I hope my question makes sense, I just don't see how to printf a string, sc=
anf something into a value/do stuff with that value, and then print the rem=
ainder on the same line. Thanks!
