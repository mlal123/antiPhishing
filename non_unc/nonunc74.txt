n: Emergency Drill near Municipal Drive, Carolina North Forest on Monday, A=
ugust 10

Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:

As part of the University=E2=80=99s commitment to continuously enhance safe=
ty on campus, I am writing to let you know about an emergency preparedness =
drill that will be conducted near Municipal Drive and the main Carolina Nor=
th Forest entrance on Monday, August. 10.

These annual emergency planning drills are vital to our every-day efforts t=
o prepare for a variety of potential scenarios. This exercise in a controll=
ed learning environment will provide invaluable feedback about our current =
response plans and inform our ongoing collaborative work with local law enf=
orcement agencies and first responders.

The drill site is on UNC property about two miles north of main campus off =
the Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Municipal Drive. The exercise will=
 be confined to buildings and grounds near the Carolina North Land Manageme=
nt and Trail Information Office, which will be closed that day. Municipal D=
rive will remain open, and Carolina North Forest users will have access to =
the main parking lot and gravel road leading to the trail area. Police offi=
cers will be stationed around the perimeter of a clearly marked drill area.=
 Traffic pattern and flow informational signage will be used to delineate t=
he boundaries of the drill area. We expect activity at the drill site betwe=
en about 7 a.m. and 2 p.m.

Emergency vehicles and personnel will be visible in and around the Carolina=
 North office and nearby buildings. Uniformed officers and other first resp=
onders will use training equipment during a simulated response as if there =
were an actual campus emergency. People near the drill site may see actors =
or hear loud noises including mock gun fire.=20

We selected this date because it falls between the end of summer classes an=
d the back-to-school period of increased activity on campus and in the comm=
unity. To further minimize disruptions and confusion, we will not activate =
normal campus emergency communications, including sounding the sirens and s=
ending text messages and emails.=20

After the fall semester begins, we will ask you to familiarize yourself wit=
h actions you would need to take in an actual emergency.  On August 26, we =
will conduct the annual fall semester siren test, which will include sendin=
g text messages and emails to the campus community. This is an important op=
portunity for students, faculty and staff =E2=80=93 especially those new to=
 campus =E2=80=93 to review emergency procedures. You can find a wealth of =
information, including safety tips and safety-related resources available o=
n campus, at Alert Carolina (http://alertcarolina.unc.edu) and Safe@UNC (ht=
tp://safe.unc.edu/).

Nothing is more important to our University than the safety of our students=
, faculty and staff.  Your Department of Public Safety, a fully accredited =
law enforcement agency, and our campus and local community partners are com=
mitted to regular training activities to ensure that our staffs are as prep=
ared as possible to protect you.

Sincerely,

Chief Jeff McCracken
Director of Public Safety
