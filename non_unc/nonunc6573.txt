Hamming question

I'm trying to make sure I=C2=A0 understand a few things about the capabilit=
ies of our Hamming program.=C2=A0 Are we to make=C2=A0 sure it finds the ha=
mming distance of any two hexes of arbitrary length (given the examples of =
much shorter length than md5 or sha256 output) or are we making it with a c=
hosen bit length in mind?=C2=A0 If I used SHA256 or MDA5, then I could pad =
0s to their respective bit counts for my comparisons.=C2=A0 Dynamically pad=
ding 0s to match the longer binary length would work in all cases, right?=
=C2=A0 Since any additional leading 0s to get to more typical bit counts wo=
uldn't add to the hamming distance anyway.
