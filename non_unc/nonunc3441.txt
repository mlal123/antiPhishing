Iterator remove method not working  (11/10/16 7:55 PM)

I was trying to use remove method of Iterator to remove edges and nodes fro=
m my hash maps;
but sometimes iterator().remove() just failed silently( no exception displa=
yed in console but the object supposed to be removed from hash map remains =
there.)

Anyone have some ideas about the reason and possible solution for this?

Using List instead of String[]  (11/10/16 10:26 PM)

I find it alot easier to write the topoSort as a ArrayList than as an array=
. Is it possible to turn it in like this (fails RunTests but works correctl=
y)?
