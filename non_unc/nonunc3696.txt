With regards to submitting for late grading (and end of semester notes)

With the end of the semester rolling around and people trying to get stuff =
finished and graded, I want to re-emphasize a point. Please share this with=
 classmates not using piazza (you all should be). You are graded on an assi=
gnment only once, if you submit an assignment before the due date, once tha=
t due date rolls around I will grade what is there. Unless there are extrem=
e circumstances (and we have permitted you to resubmit for a different grad=
e), I will not grade you again. We have re submissions open only for late s=
ubmissions, and perhaps if you made a mistake and want to submit another dr=
aft BEFORE the deadline. That is it. It is not an invitation to submit a be=
tter draft way late down the road in hopes of getting a new grade. Remember=
 to email us at help-comp410@cs.unc.edu if you have questions regarding gra=
des/assignments. Dr.Stotts will be answering emails directed to him specifi=
cally via this channel in the near future (so don't be disheartened if you =
have not heard back from him yet). He will also be giving you more logistic=
al info in the last class so stay tuned, just wanted to preface that with o=
ur grading policy beforehand. Good luck with the end of the semester all of=
 you.
