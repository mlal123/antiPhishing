=E2=80=9CThe first question to ask is: which of the six legal grounds unde=
r the GDPR should you rely on to process personal data? Consent is only on=
e ground. The others are contract=2C legal obligation=2C vital interests=
=2C public interest and legitimate interests. Even if you are relying on c=
onsent=2C that still does not mean you have to ask for consent again. Reci=
tal 171 of the GDPR makes clear you can continue to rely on any existing c=
onsent that was given in line with the GDPR requirements=2C and there=E2=
=80=99s no need to seek fresh consent. Just make sure that your consent me=
