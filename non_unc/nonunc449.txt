Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Story.k is not printing  (9/29/15 4:31 PM)

I have Story.k outside of the main if / else if / else statement but it is not printing. Should i put K after every ending branch in the if / else statement or do I leave it at the end?
