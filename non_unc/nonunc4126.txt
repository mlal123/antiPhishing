Here's what has happened in MATH 233 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
HW - Section 12.3 #4  (1/23/17 12:23 PM)

Find the angle between the vectors. (First find an exact expression and the=
n approximate to the nearest degree.)

a =3D <7,3>=C2=A0 and b=3D <3,-1>

I got up to cos(theta) =3D 7(3) + 3(-1) / sqrt( <7,3> DOT <7,3>) * sqrt( <3=
,-1> DOT <3,-1>)
and that equaled 18/ sqrt(58) * sqrt(10)
I have to get the approximate and exact theta value.

How would I get the inverse?

Also, inputting the exact value, should I use the cos^-1 function provided =
by Webassign?
