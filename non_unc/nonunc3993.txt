PM Session Wednesdays at 4:30pm

Hi!!

Just wanted to give y'all a heads-up that my peer mentor sessions (unless I have a big schedule change) will be Wednesdays 4:30-5:30pm at the Genome Cafe in GSB, starting next week. Come by, say hey, and bring questions about BIOL 101 material and study strategies. Bringing good memes is also encouraged (pls). Hope to see you next Wednesday!
