Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
RunTests  (10/03/16 2:47 PM)

No matter what I do runTests does not work. =C2=A0My package is named corre=
ctly and I followed the steps to put in the localchecks Jar as usual(includ=
ing buildpath). =C2=A0I always get "Assignment3Suite cannot be resolved" =
=C2=A0as if the jar and build path are not correct. =C2=A0

------------------------------------------------------------
binary heap v.s minimum binary heap  (10/03/16 2:56 PM)

Is there a difference between binary heap and a minimum binary heap?

Seems like both are BST with the following properties:
1) a node's child is always larger than the node;
2) the BST is complete (each node except the leaves have both left and righ=
t child)
