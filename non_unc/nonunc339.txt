Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Study Guide - Quiz 2

Couple quick questions:

1. for #6, is the output just "You can't hide. I'm gonna fiiiiind you." because ready and !ready and both not true?
2. for #7-8, isn't the output originally just the most recent right one (go to pg 13 movies)? If so, then what is the difference in #8?
3. How would you go about #9?

Quiz is in an hour so any help would be much appreciated! Thanks!!
