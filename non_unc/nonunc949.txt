Assignment B UI

I pulled 4B and then run Class Assignment 4B but the UI didn't show up. There is "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Width (0) and height (0) cannot be <= 0 at java.awt.image.DirectColorModel.createCompatibleWritableRaster(Unknown Source) at java.awt.image.BufferedImage.(Unknown Source) at com.comp110.instagram.ImageUtils.loadPhoto(ImageUtils.java:80) at com.comp110.instagram.ImageUtils.loadPhoto(ImageUtils.java:74) at com.comp110.instagram.Assignment4B.main(Assignment4B.java:15)"
