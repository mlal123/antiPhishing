With the Duke Men's Basketball ticket distribution approaching, the CAA and UNC Ticket Office are making an effort to confirm graduation status with students.  As always, the Duke Men's Basketball distribution is a Senior/Graduating Grad student priority distribution.  The winners of this distribution will be awarded 1 (one) ticket. 

The latest information we received from the registrar's office regarding the Duke student ticket distribution indicates you ARE NOT graduating in the 2017 calendar year.  If this information is correct, you do not need to take any further action in regards to your status.  If you feel this information is incorrect, you will need to visit the Ticket Office, in person, with a printout confirming your graduation status.  This information can be found on your Connect Carolina account.  Once you have signed into your Connect Carolina account, on the left hand side navigation bar click on "My Academics" then click on "View Graduation Status."  Your current graduation status should be shown here.  Print out this page and bring it to the ticket office during normal business hours in order to correct your graduation status.

The deadline to confirm graduation status with the Ticket Office is Monday, February 20, 2017 at 4:30 pm.  Verification of senior status does not guarantee that you will receive a ticket through the senior distribution.

The Ticket Office is located in the Ernie Williamson Athletic Center.  The Ticket Office is open Monday through Friday 8:30 am to 4:30 pm.

****REMEMBER**** 

To be eligible, you MUST register for the Duke Basketball game lottery online at www.GoHeels.com before the deadline to be considered.  Registration begins February 22, 2017 at 10:00am.  Registration ends February 24, 2017 at 11:59pm.  Registering online and confirming your graduation status does not guarantee a ticket to the game.  You will be notified on February 25th, 2017 whether or not you received a ticket for the Duke game.
