14.2 Question Geralds

I was wondering if I could clarify the strategy for determining if a limit exists with more than one variable. So the first step is to plug in the values for x and y that the function is approaching, and then if there is no domain restriction, the value we get is the limit? On the other end, if we plug in the values for x and y, and we have a domain restriction such as a denominator being equal to 0, then we use what we learned with using different paths and finding out if they all give the same value? Thanks!
