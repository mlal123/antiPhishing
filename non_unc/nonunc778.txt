Help zipping!!!  (11/07/15 1:24 AM)

I was waiting for an answer to a question on here to submit my assignment, and I forgot to submit it. When I check my zip file, it says that at least one .java file is outside of the source folder. I cannot figure out how to fix this. I went ahead and submitted what I have since it is already late, but can someone please help me so I can try to resubmit it? Thank you
