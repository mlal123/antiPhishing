***********************************************

Hello mlal123,

We=E2=80=99re excited to announce a few updates coming to
Codecademy in the next few days! With this update, we=E2=80=99re
introducing a brand new dashboard and course catalog page.
Furthermore, we=E2=80=99re temporarily changing how we show course
progress. Read on to find out more.

Tracking Progress in the New Dashboard
--------------------------------------

With this release, we=E2=80=99re changing how we show
course progress; now, you=E2=80=99ll get progress on a course once you
complete the entire lesson. This may result in seeing your
reported progress go down, but don=E2=80=99t worry, you haven=E2=80=99t act=
ually
lost progress and you=E2=80=99ll be able to jump right back into the
exercise you left off. This is temporary and will change in the
next few months as we release additional updates.

Focus on What You=E2=80=99re Learning
-----------------------------

Upon signing in, you=E2=80=99ll discover a new dashboard
that contains all the courses you=E2=80=99re taking. Jump right back
where you left off, or browse the courses you=E2=80=99re taking (or
already completed) right there in the dashboard.

Wondering What to Learn Next?
-----------------------------

The new catalog page makes it easier to figure
that out by letting you filter courses by different categories
that range from Web Development to Data Analytics. Want to know
what everyone else is doing? Sort by popularity. Want to get
ahead of the curve? Sort by Most Recent and get the latest skills
today!

A New Look
----------

You=E2=80=99ll also notice the site looks a bit
different! We=E2=80=99re adjusting the interface to provide more detail
and let you see more information, like the contents of course, at
a glance.

Happy coding!
