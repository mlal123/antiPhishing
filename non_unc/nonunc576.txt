Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
lab 2 saving numbers into array  (10/17/15 11:12 AM)

how do you physically=C2=A0"save the number into the array" that the user e=
nters if its a multiple of 3 and how do you not save it into the array if i=
t's not a multiple of 3? Would you have to declare the number they enter as=
 an integer? If so I'm confused because when writing the program, you don't=
 know how many integers there will be since it's up to the user to decide.
