Question in 16.7

Hi,=C2=A0

I am just wondering how can we know a vector is positive or negative orient=
ed. For example, how can we know r(u) x r(v) is positive or r(v) x r(u) is =
positive?=C2=A0

Also, I am a bit confused by the solution on the following picture. Don't w=
e need another r since we are using polar coordinate? I thought it should b=
e (r^2+16)*r^2.=C2=A0

Thank you.=C2=A0
