Exercise for 10/22  (10/26/15 4:08 PM)

Would anyone happen to have the exercise Prof. Aikat did in Eclipse=C2=A0on=
 10/22? It involved a nested for loop for a 2D array and "getSum." I accide=
ntally messed up my file, but I'd like to have the exercise in Eclipse as n=
otes, so if anyone could share with me, that would be great!=C2=A0
