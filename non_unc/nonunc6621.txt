Report Preimage question

When we run our preimage code 15 times to get an avg time to crack, should we be running the code on 15 different sha256 hashes, or on one? The question is pretty ambiguous. This obviously will have pretty big consequences on the average time, as some hashes take a longer amount of time (at least in my algo) than others to crack.. I assume it's on 15 different hashes so we can't skew the data by choosing a hash we know will take a the shortest amount of time. Thanks.
