Hello my name is Mangza Lal, I am a Computer Science BS major and currently
a junior at UNC-Chapel Hill. I heard from Ahmed that the ACE Cyber Security
Boot Camp is open to the public and I was interested in potentially applying
for the program. What steps do I need to take to move on forward?
