Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
LinkedList  (11/09/16 10:48 PM)

This is perhaps a very simple question but if we use a linked list implemen=
tation will we get points deducted or will it still be fine?

Tests not matched with grader?  (11/09/16 11:12 PM)

I'm=C2=A0currently not passing AddNodeTest1 in the autograder, but when tes=
ting it myself it seems to work. When I expand the tab in the grader it tel=
ls me "addNode(2,f) =3D=3Dfalse":


However, based on the testdump, it looks like=C2=A0AddNodeTest1 is only tes=
ting:
Case 1:Duplicate ID
addNode(1, f)
addNode(1, e) =3D=3D False
So it doesn't look like it corresponds with the AddNodeTest1 that I'm faili=
ng with the autograder since addNode(2,f) isn't in Case 1 of the test. The=
=C2=A0"addNode(2,f) =3D=3Dfalse" does correspond to AddNodeTest2's test cas=
es, but I'm passing that one with the autograder (which I actually don't th=
ink I should be based off my code). Am I missing something here, or are the=
 test cases accidentally swapped?=C2=A0

Topo Sort  (11/10/16 12:03 AM)

In topo sort we are supported to return an array of strings with each strin=
g corresponding to that particular node's label. However, how are we suppos=
ed to know what size to construct this array with?

Test Cases  (11/10/16 12:28 AM)

For some of the topo test cases, I fail the tests and get the message:Topo =
contains the nodes it should. I am not exactly sure how to correct this, wh=
en I run the playground it outputs them correctly.

Delete Node, Finding all edges in all Hashmaps  (11/10/16 2:18 AM)

So I used a for each loop to iterate through all the different hashmaps, bu=
t when I try to remove the edges I need to get rid of I get a ConcurrentMod=
ificationException. =C2=A0I guess this is from modifying the hasmaps within=
 the for each loop, but what would I do to get rid of everything then.=C2=
=A0
