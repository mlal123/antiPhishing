Your classmate posted a new Question. 

load word and store word

kind of a dumb quesiton, but why do load word and store word addresses need to be a multiple of 4? I kind of understand it, but it just isn't really clicking yet. If someone could help to explain that I'd appreciate it. Thanks.
