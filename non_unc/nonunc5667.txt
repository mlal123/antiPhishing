It has come to our attention that you have not yet confirmed your membershi=
p in The National Society of Collegiate Scholars.

I'm writing to you from the NSCS National Office Headquarters in Washington=
, D.C., to confirm your decision. You are one of the very few 2017 nominees=
 from the NSCS chapter at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill t=
hat we have not yet heard from. Please advise us of your decision as soon a=
s possible.

You can join now by visiting http://links.nscs.mkt3303.com/ctt?kn=3D12&ms=

Mangza, I don't want you to miss out on a great opportunity. However, if yo=
u are declining membership, please click here by July 13 to officially decl=
ine your invitation: http://www.pages03.net/nscs/nscsinvitepreferences/Fill=

We will then remove your name permanently from our records and inform your =
chapter officers that you will not be participating in the New Member Induc=
tion Ceremony, scheduled to take place this fall.

By now, I'm sure you already know that less than 10 percent of students at =
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill qualify for membership in N=
SCS each year and that you have earned a nomination because of your outstan=
ding academic performance. Membership in NSCS will open the door to new lea=
dership and professional development opportunities that add power to your r=
esume. Perhaps even more helpful to your future is the vast network of NSCS=
 alumni who have achieved success in a broad range of fields, including mor=
e than a dozen Rhodes Scholars, nearly 200 Fulbright Scholars, and 14 membe=
rs of the 2017 Forbes 30 Under 30 list.=20
