**Good Morning Y'all and Happy Wednesday!**

I've been writing your newsletter for a week now so I think it's time for=
 a confession: My family loves musical birthday cards. Specifically, my d=
ad and his brother love them. From the time I was a child to recent young=
-adult years, I have received a musical birthday card.=C2=A0

The songs range from "Who Let the Dogs Out?" to Spongebob himself singing=
 Happy Birthday. Opening them is always a harrowing experience. Because y=
ou always forget that musical cards exist. And these cards are never quie=
t. They are loud and make you literally jump as soon as The Who starts sh=
outing "Won't Get Fooled Again." (That card was actually my favorite.)

o? Just look up the lyrics to the song above. I can't help that I have a =
dad that grew up in the 60s.=C2=A0
