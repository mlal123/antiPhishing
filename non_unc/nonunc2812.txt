Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

Size Test #4  (9/26/16 9:06 PM)

I have run the oracle test and all of my tests pass except for size(0 number 4. However, when I put what the test dump asked me into the playground, I received a size output of 2. The test says the expected size is 2, but still fails the test.

Using our own methods  (9/26/16 9:12 PM)

Hello all!

For assignment 3, are we allowed to create additional methods within the MinBinHeap implementation? Personally, I only have a few lines of code for the insert() method, and have most of the work done by an additional public method I created. Thanks!
