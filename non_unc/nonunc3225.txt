Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
ex1.asm permission denied  (10/26/16 11:25 PM)

after I do this:
% java -jar /home/fuchs/comp411/bin/Mars4_5.jar nc mc CompactDataAtZero 
ex1.asm < ex1in1.ppm > ex1result1.pgm

I get "ex1.asm: permission denied."

How do I fix this? I just want to run my file...
