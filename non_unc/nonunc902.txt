Assignment 4B Part 3.1

Does the memory address pointed by an=C2=A0object variable change? I find t=
hat my Filter will=C2=A0not be successfully processed if I do not update my=
 output image by assigning each effect back to it in the loop. But,=C2=A0is=
n't an object=C2=A0variable like "output image" stored by its=C2=A0memory=
=C2=A0address? That being said, when we pass the object as a=C2=A0parameter=
, the corresponding method receives the memory address pointed by the param=
eter and then changes relative functions within this object, but the memory=
 address remains the same?
