Here's what has happened in COMP 435 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
For loop  (9/08/17 2:32 PM)

The assignment says, "You should not be looping through the hex values multiple times looking for duplicates." Is this means i cannot have any nested for loop but i can have different for loops?

I downloaded Python 3 through the terminal like instructed but the version is 3.2.3, does it have to be version 3.6?
