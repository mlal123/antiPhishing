Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

MARS not assembling  (11/17/16 5:43 PM)

I'm having an issue with getting MARS to run my MIPS code. I have the two files set up using the little template provided in the assignment description for Lab 10. I am passing my $a0 to fibonacci using " jal fibonacci ". Everything is unchecked in Settings, except the following which are checked: :assemble all files in directory," "permit extended (pseudo) instructions and formats." Only file I have open is the main one, but it still does this when I have both files open and the main one selected.

When I press the screwdriver / wrench button, the readout in MARS Messages along the bottom says "Assemble: assembling" but nothing happens and the pause/play buttons never become colored and available.

What am I doing wrong?
