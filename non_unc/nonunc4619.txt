Hi! I'm having my normal PM session today from 4:30-5:30 in Genome Cafe. Come ask questions!!

Also, I am holding an EXTRA PM session this week because I cancelled one after the first exam. It will be this FRIDAY at 3-4pm in Genome Cafe. If you're studying for your second exam and need some help, come on by.
