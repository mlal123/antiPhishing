Direct Cache Mapping  (12/01/16 7:58 PM)

Hello,
If mapping an address requires one to place the word in the second byte in =
a line, would we also have to change the first byte to match the previous e=
ntry from memory? For example, in slideset 16 slide 17, tag 1024 has 44 and=
 99 (corresponding to addresses 1024 and 1028 in main memory). So, if we ha=
d to map something that would end up in 99's spot, would we also replace 44=
? Thanks!
