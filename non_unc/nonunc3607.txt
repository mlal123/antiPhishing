Your classmate posted a new Question.=20

Where to create the struct

The book says that you can define structs in an external file and use #incl=
ude at the top of your main file to include it. At the same time I think we=
 can also define structs within the same main file and use it within that f=
ile. Is there a specific way we are supposed to do this? I have chosen to c=
reate a separate struct file but can just as easily move things into my mai=
n file.=C2=A0
