s)
=E2=80=9CWe should be drawing many small lessons about misinformation from=

The $4.99/month ESPN+ =E2=80=9Cmust be successful=2C but not so successful=

=E2=80=9CTools were launched in May 2016 to encourage publishers to source=

 their content on Reddit could be warned or banned if they violated the pl=
