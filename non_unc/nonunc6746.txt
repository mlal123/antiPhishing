Here's what has happened in COMP 435 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Ambiguity and nitty gritty on valid characters  (10/10/17 10:44 PM)

Other posts have confirmed that whitespace and special characters are OK. (=
@124 @105) However, what's still murky for me is how this works with the ou=
tput of the collision assignment, since the separator for the two strings i=
s a space.

For example, the collision sample output was this:
12856fhjasbfjhebw 739fhjasbfjhebw

However, since whitespace is allowed, this should also be a valid output (p=
retending these strings had a collision)
12856fhj asbfjhebw739fhja sbfjhebw

This=C2=A0means there is ambiguity between the strings being
"12856fhj asbfjhebw739fhja" and=C2=A0 "sbfjhebw", or
"12856fhj" and "asbfjhebw739fhja sbfjhebw"

Is this simply such a bizarre case that it should be disregarded?

Similarly, are all whitespace characters allowed (space, newline, tab, ...)=
, or spaces only?

Additionally, the reasoning in @105=C2=A0for punctuation being allowed is t=
hat it still has a valid hash. On that note, does that mean absolutely any =
unicode character is allowed, or only printable characters, or only printab=
les minus whitespace except space?
