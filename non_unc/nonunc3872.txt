Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Midterm AVL Question  (12/15/16 2:27 PM)

Could someone please explain why this is false?

Q3: In an AVL tree, when the longest path and the shortest path differ by 2=
 or more, we always do a balance operation:
a)=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 True=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 b) False=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 c) it=E2=80=99s not that simple
