Part 2 in problem set 5  (12/03/16 8:11 PM)

After we do the first problem, are we supposed to use the new cache in the =
subsequent problems? Also, what does the third column in the direct mapped =
cache represent?=C2=A0

Ex: The first row in the set up is 2016 66 23. 66 is the data and 2016 is t=
