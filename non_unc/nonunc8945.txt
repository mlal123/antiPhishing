Our classroom is Brawner 476 (upstairs from the main floor).  Attached is y=
our guest parking permit.  When you turn into Menlo, follow the parking lot =
to the far left and park as close to the back of the quad as possible.   Tha=
t will get you closest to Brawner.  There is a campus map here.  Brawner is =
building 10.  =20

Hi Jen, looking forward to being with the students tomorrow! Just wanted to=
 ask a few quick details:

Where do I go at Menlo - do I need to ask for anyone in particular?
Do I need a parking pass?
Is there a whiteboard in the classroom?
Start time is 9am?
I got a confirmation from the bus company so I=E2=80=99m set there.
I=E2=80=99ll bring copies of Carbon=E2=80=99s visitor agreement for them to sign (unles=
s you=E2=80=99ve already covered that).
Anything else?
Thanks again & have a wonderful time on your trip!
