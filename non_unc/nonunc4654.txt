PM Session TODAY 3-4

Hey, *~reminder~* that I'm having an extra PM session TODAY at 3pm-4pm in Genome Cafe!

If you haven't been to one before, I'll basically just be hanging out at a table and waiting for y'all to bring questions. That could be learning catalytics questions from lecture that you didn't understand, or from the practice exam, or just general concept questions.

See you there!
Ben
