EVERYONE PLEASE READ

Hey everyone. Have graded late assignments (except for some outlier cases). At this point in time save for those cases everyone's grade is what we think it should be at this moment. First, take a breath. Do NOT resubmit to sakai from this point on. Doing so will erase your old grade. At this point thats pretty much giving yourself a zero. Just don't do it! Instead if you have issues with grades email the help address. Include your onyen in the subject and the assignment in question.
Everyone please take a look at @490
I will be in sitterson from noon until about 8PM tommorrow and will ping my location on that thread as it updates. Tommorrow is the day we figure out any grading discrepancies. Please either email 410 help or come see me in person if you want to "prove" you should have a different grade on an assignment. We will deal with it right there.
On a less stressful note please review us TAs/LAs! @485
Only have 8 responses so far would love more!! Please help us be better :)
Good luck to all of you on the rest of exams!
