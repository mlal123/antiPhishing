Good Afternoon,

My name is Captain Quentin LeDay and I am the officer recruiter with the U.=
S. Marine Corps stationed here in Raleigh, NC.=20

reshmen through juniors and Officer Candidate Course (OCC) for seniors and =
graduates. This program provides top-notch leadership training and the oppo=

s you to continue your studies while earning your commission as a Marine Of=
ficer. This is a little-known elite program that is designed to develop and=
 evaluate your abilities to lead large groups of your peers, while evaluati=
