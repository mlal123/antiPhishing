**Good Morning and Happy Wednesday!**

I am from Atlanta, a city known as the epicenter of bad traffic. I admit =
it's true. The traffic there is horrendous and I have learned to be egreg=
iously early because of that. I thought it would be smooth sailing up her=

I was wrong.

While driving up here =C2=A0I discovered a kind of purgatory that goes by=

lane, nightmarish clutches on a more frequent basis. If you don't know wh=
at I'm talking about, great! Don't go.

**Tunesday revisited**

Honestly y'all, today was a wild day for me. Between technology glitches =
