Your classmate posted a new Question.=20

For loops

In a for loop, is the increment performed before the action required in the=
 loop, or afterwards? For example, in the following code:=C2=A0

int a;
for (int i =3D 0; i<5; i++) {
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 a =3D 5*i;
}

when calculating "a", will the program use 0 the first time through and the=
n increment to 1, or will it increment to 1 and then use 1 to calculate "a"=
 the first time through?=C2=A0
