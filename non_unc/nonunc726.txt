Assignment 3: rollResult Method Call?

So, in Game.java, under the method rollResult(), we have to call the roll() method we created in Die.java. I created the roll() method, and it passes the test when I run the program. But I can't figure out how to successfully call the roll() method from the Die.java class within the Game.java class? Whenever I try to call it under rollResult(), it says that there is no method named roll() created? I've looked at the other posts on here about this step, but I still can't figure it out. Someone please simplify it?
