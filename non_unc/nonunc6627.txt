Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Runtime of Collision

In the assignment it says our runtime has to be under 15 seconds. My code occasionally gets runtime under 15 seconds and occasionally gets runtime above 15 seconds (sometimes it takes less than one, sometimes it takes upwards of a minute).

Is there any guideline on what exactly can be submitted? Also, can I post my code here and get tips on how to make it faster?
