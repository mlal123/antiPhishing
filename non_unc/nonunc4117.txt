Hi!

I'll be holding a PM session tomorrow from 12:30 - 1:30 in Genome Cafe. I'll have a sign that has my name on it so you can recognize me! You can come with questions or if you want we can just go over notes and review. Also, if you wanna just come hang with me for an hour and eat some lunch you are more than welcome!
