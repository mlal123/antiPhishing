Here's what has happened in COMP 435 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
On the Ethernet packet spoofing  (12/03/17 2:31 PM)

An announcement on the Ethernet packet spoofing.=C2=A0

If you use the send() function when specifying an ethernet frame, scapy wil=
l attempt to send the packet on layer 3. Ethernet frames exist on layer 2, =
so you will need to look into a function like sendp(packet_name, iface=3D"e=
thX" ) which sends on layer 2.=C2=A0 Otherwise it will not send a valid eth=
ernet frame. Whenever you run your script, check it out in Wireshark to ver=
ify that the packet left your box.=C2=A0

Beginning of HW5  (12/03/17 2:10 PM)

Two questions:
For task 1.a where we have to run sniffer, in the terminal I entered sudo .=
/sniffex, and got a list of 10 packets, is that the information we are actu=
ally going after?

And for Problems 1-2: Should we be getting this information from the tcpdum=
p.org site?
