Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

Boolean Methods  (11/04/15 11:08 AM)

So I've declared a new variable to call the roll method in the Die class for rollResult and have moved on to determining if snakeEyes or rolledOneOnlyOnce are true or not. Whenever I call these into an if statement and include the variables in rollResult, I get the error "The method snakeEyes (int, int) in the type Game is not applicable for the arguments (Die, Die)". I understand in the method rollResult it uses the object Die and not int, but I'm not sure what else to do without changing the snakeEyes method. Does anyone have any insight?
