Getting different hash values when running in VM

I know this doesn't matter that much, but when I run the commands to genera=
te hashes in my VM, like
"openssl dgst -sha256=C2=A0filename",
I do not get the same results as the hash sums in the assignment write up, =
or on this website. For example, if my input file is "The quick brown fox j=
umps over the lazy dog", the assignment page gets "d7a8fbb307d7809469ca9abc=
b0082e4f8d5651e46d3cdb762d02d0bf37c9e592" as the hash sum, and so does the =
website. In my VM, however, I get "c03905fcdab297513a620ec81ed46ca44ddb62d4=
1cbbd83eb4a5a3592be26a69". Does anyone know why this is happening, or how t=
o fix it?
