Your classmate posted a new Question. 

3b

For question 3b, are we assuming that the array we are sorting has a non-uniform distribution? Isn't the whole point of bucketsort that we get an expected linear sort if the data is uniform, despite having to perform an n^2 sort for every subfile? Do we just ignore that fact or does it compound the problem somehow?
