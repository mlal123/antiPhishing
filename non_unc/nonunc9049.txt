Can product-centric thinking stave off innovative thinking rather than enc=

=E2=80=9CFor example=2C a good product that is designed to automatically g=
enerate transcripts for journalists is likely to only include features tha=
t help its users achieve that end goal. A feature that that might allow th=
e generation of subtitles from the transcripts would be considered superfl=
uous to the end product. However=2C generating subtitles or auto-exporting=
 segments of audio may later form the basis of a new product. Because you=
