Lab1 Question  (9/09/15 3:01 PM)

Does anyone think it would be a problem if I declared separate variables fo=
r sum, product, quotient, etc and assigned it the designated operation betw=
een num1 and num2? It would still output the same values, the operation how=
ever could be executed in the variable declaration rather than in the Print=
lns, so I could actually do

System.out.prinln("The quotient is: " + quotient); ...... quotient already =
being calculated above and outputting as the answer to the operation
