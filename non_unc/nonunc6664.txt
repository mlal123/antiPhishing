How to construct brute force algorithim for preimage resistance

Should we start at string length 1 and try all the hashes and then move to length 2, or is acceptable if we just randomly generated a string of ascii characters of say length 8, since by pidgeon hole principle, there has to be at least 1 string that will have the same first 24 bits of hash at length 8?
