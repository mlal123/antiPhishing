   Hello.
   I have a disability. It's an impediment of my speech and there isn't
   much that i can say.
   I am looking for someone who can take care of some parts of my day that
   may require conversation. Someone that can help me out with my income
   returns.
   I accept cash to partake in surveys, but sometimes, i may need to talk
   to a few people to make observations. I can't speak properly, so i
   really think most people just write down what they think they should. I
   know it's really better to have a conversation with them so i don't get
   mechanical answers. The real problem is, I shouldnat even let them know
   they are being observed. I hope you understand.
   This is the reason why i need someone who can talk when at the point of
   survey just to get an honest opinion with tactical questions. I think i
   will get better results.
   I feel bad taking money and not really actually having to make a
   conversation, when it is actually required of me to do so. I can't give
   up, because i really need this.
   From what i make in a week, I am willing to pay $500 every week; i will
   still be left with a third quarter of what I get paid for the week. Iam
   trying to save to get my vocal cord repaired, because its twice as hard
   for me, not being able to speak properly.
   There are 3 survey points at Walmart, KFC, UPS and these are the places
   you will have to go to.
   It's hard to find someone I can trust to get the honest opinions that I
   need.
   I will understand if you do not wish to help me and would appreciate if
   you just don't respond, rather than insult me. I know its not easy
   trusting a total stranger.
