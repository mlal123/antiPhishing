Your classmate posted a new Question. 

write up for exercise 4

Will there not be a write up for assignment4 on the 410 website like there usually is? Assignment 4 is up on Sakai but I'm not seeing anything on the site like normal. If it's just not up then no worries. Just wondering. Thanks.
