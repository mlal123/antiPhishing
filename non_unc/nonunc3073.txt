Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Answer Key  (10/15/16 9:24 PM)

For question 1 in the sample problem packet, we are asked to give an algori=
thm, yet the answer key doesn't give a specific pseudo-code definition of t=
he algorithm, rather it gives a broad explanation of how to approach the al=
gorithm.

Will we be required to write actual code for questions like this on the exa=
m? Or will answers similar to the answer key be sufficient?Thanks!
