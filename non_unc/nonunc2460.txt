Rain, winds related to Hurricane Hermine possible in Triangle

As of Thursday afternoon (September 1), weather forecasters were predicting that Hurricane Hermine will move along North Carolina's coast and Outer Banks regions Friday into early Saturday morning.  Forecasters are predicting that impacts felt in Triangle region may be limited to periods of heavy rain and gusty winds, but the storm has already shown a tendency to change course.

As such, the University is closely tracking reports from emergency management agencies about this storm and is taking precautions to keep the campus community safe.  Please take the potential for threatening weather seriously.  Monitor local media and pay attention to changing conditions that could affect your safety.

In central North Carolina, forecasters are predicting the possibility of anywhere from two to six inches of rain (with greater amounts along and east of the I-95 corridor) and wind gusts in excess of 30 miles per hour by Friday evening.  Please use common sense and avoid areas prone to flooding; watch for falling limbs or trees (saturated soil may make it easier for trees to fall, even with modest wind gusts).

The University is currently operating on a normal schedule.  Although this storm is not expected to affect campus operations, conditions could change.
