Please don't submit more than once on sakai after "recieving a grade"

This blows away the old grade we gave you, which results in a 0. We will fix it up this once. But from now on, if you need to "resubmit" after the intial grades come out (which shouldn't happen anymore since you guys should always be submitting correctly now), please email us at the help email address. Do not just resubmit on sakai and pass the buck to us. It will not work out in your favor.
