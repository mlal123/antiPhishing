null charater ASCII value

When I wrote my assembly code, I stopped looping through a_to_i when I read in the null character. All the ASCII charts and the assignment said that the null character value is 0. However, I found that it was 10. My code worked perfectly when I broke out of the loop when I read in 10. Anyone know why this might have happened?
