Hey Morrison Residents,

Do you like FREE food? Hate it when you miss free pizza or snacks and other events in your residence hall? Well sign up for our secure, tested RHA text notification list. It is simple! Use your cell phone, and follow the instructions below to sign up for notifications at your community. You will only be texted when there are free programs in your hall, never any outside solicitations or advertisements. Your number will only display as your name on our end, and we clear all contacts at the end of the year. How easy is that?

Text @morrunc to 810-10 to get notified every time there is free food or an event at your residence hall.
*Standard messaging rates apply. Contact Hiren Gihwala at hirengih@live.unc.edu for more info/troubleshooting.
