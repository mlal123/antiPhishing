Homework Grade

How is the homework grade calculated?=C2=A0 I am trying to come up with my =
homework grade for the course right now.=C2=A0 I understand that the lowest=
 one is dropped, but how is everything else calculated?=C2=A0 I thought tha=
t I heard in class that points were going to be added at some point.

Is the grade calculated like this:
HW1: 30/50 =3D 60%
HW2: 25/100 =3D 25%

HW Grade: AVG(60 and 25) =3D 42.5%=C2=A0 =C2=A0

OR

HW1: 30/50 =3D 60%
HW2: 25/100 =3D 25%

HW Grade: (30 + 25) / (100 + 50)=C2=A0 =3D 36.6%
