Hello 7 on 7 IM players,

UNC Club Football is pleased to announce that we are having our first
Stuart Scott Memorial 7 on 7 flag football tournament on Hooker Fields next
Saturday, April 8th! As some of you may know, Stuart is not only a beloved
alumnus of North Carolina, but of UNC Club Football (
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DaQ1J-suO1VY) as well. We are inviting UNC
students and anyone else in the UNC community to form teams to participate
in the 16 team flag football tournament. Each team needs at least 7
players, and the $15 entry fee comes with drinks, a meal, and tournament
t-shirt similar to the flier posted below! *All proceeds will benefit the
Stuart Scott Memorial Cancer Research Fund* located here
