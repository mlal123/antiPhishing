Make-up office hours

Hello all,

I was unable to hold office hours today morning due to unforeseen circumstances, and so I am holding make-up office hours tomorrow afternoon, on Tuesday, at 3 pm - 4 pm in the usual venue (SN 373). You may also email me if you have any questions about the homework assignments or the grading.

Best regards,
Rohan
