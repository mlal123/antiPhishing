Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Problem Set 3, Part 5 (Question 23 on Sakai)

I am 100% sure that the output for inputs (A=1, B=1, C=1, D=0, E=1, F=0) equals 0. There is an error in the gradebook because this answer was marked wrong on Sakai.

I completed the truth table by hand, and just verified my result to these inputs using an online circuit builder. I invite people to check the validity of my answer, but I do believe we should receive the points for this problem back.
