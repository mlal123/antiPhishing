Duplicate Questions

Hey all, be sure to use the search capabilities of piazza and take some time to sift some of the content before asking duplicate questions. I have been seeing a good number of them as of late. It serves you and your fellow classmates well to have all of the (great) brainpower collectively put into answering questions in one piazza entry rather than being scattered among multiple duplicates of the same question/concern. Thanks!
