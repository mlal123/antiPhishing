Hello RA Candidate,

Thank you for being patient with us during our weather delays. We have heard from some of you who have conflicts on January 21st and 22nd so we have developed a make-up system that has a little bit more flexibility.

You will each be assigned to an interviewer who will email you by the end of the week about choosing an interview date and time. They will then send you a confirmation email and you will interview in their community office.

You will find out on January 25th if you have moved on to our group process. Our group process involves spotlight night on January 27th from 4:30p-8:30p and group interviews on January 28th from 8:30a-4:00p. Please be prepared for this short notice.

Again, thank you for working with us.

Sincerely,
