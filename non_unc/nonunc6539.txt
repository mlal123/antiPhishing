HW #3 Question #3

For the problem involving coming up with an algorithm for the longest palin=
drome subsequence, does our algorithm have to be the most efficient?=C2=A0 =
Part B of the problem wants us to compare our method to the best which is=
=C2=A0=CE=B8(n^2).=C2=A0 I'm assuming it just wants us to consider how effi=
cient our algorithm is compared to this; not that it has to be=C2=A0=CE=B8(=
n^2).=C2=A0 Is that a correct interpretation of the question?
