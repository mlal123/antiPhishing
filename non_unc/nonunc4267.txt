PM Session TODAY

Come on down to the bottom floor of the union (by Wendys) TODAY from 2:30-3:30 to talk about biology! We can go over anything that may be confusing so far from class/readings, and about study tips that may help you prepare for exam 1!

I'm wearing a navy blue nike shirt and/or a red patagonia jacket. 

See y'all there!
