Hello Residents!

Valentine's Day might be over but it is never too late to recognize someone that means a lot to you. RHA and ACT are teaming up this week to spread kindness and recognition across campus with candygrams and a social media campaign.


For the candygrams, there will be a limited number of candygrams. Each resident can submit one candygram that is able to be sent to another on-campus student. We will keep the form open while supplies last. The form can be found here.


There will be a social media campaign with prizes to some participants. The categories are as followed:

1.Most Tar Heel Spirit

2. Most Creative Picture with your Favorite Spot on Campus

3. Best Picture Hugging a Fellow Tar Heel

4. Best Picture Hugging your Favorite Professor or School Faculty

5. Picture showcasing you doing your favorite passion at UNC.

In order for your photos to be considered please use the hashtag #HugAHeelWeek. Submissions will be considered through all forms of social media. We are excited to see the ways that UNC has impacted you.


Lastly, there will be a celebration on Friday in the Pit. At the pit, there will be popcorn and other free food. There will also be a station for you to make cards for people who you appreciate. We hope to see you at the final celebration. Please take the time this week to use the hashtag, #HugAHeelWeek and send a candygram to a friend on campus.


Best,
