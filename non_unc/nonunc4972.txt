Hey, Tar Heels!


Following a performance by celebrated *hip-hop artist 2 Chainz*, the
Carolina Union Activities Board (CUAB) invites concertgoers to Hooker
Fields for a FREE *live streaming of the NCAA Final Four basketball game,
UNC versus Oregon!*


2 Chainz will perform at 8 p.m. sharp at Carmichael Arena on Saturday,
April 1.  The concert will end at 9 p.m. and those in attendance will be
welcomed to the neighboring field to watch UNC compete for the national
championship on a *JUMBO L.E.D. SCREEN*. Admission to the post-concert
screening of the basketball game is *FREE* and will include food and
refreshments. You do not need a concert ticket in order to attend the watch
party.


Tickets for the concert are still available at tinyurl.com/jubilee2017 or
at the Carolina Union Box Office.


We look forward to presenting 2 Chainz and a wonderful Jubilee event to the
student body. Good luck to the UNC men's basketball team as they compete
for another championship title!


GO HEELS!!


See you Saturday,
