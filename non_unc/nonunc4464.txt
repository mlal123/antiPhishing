Here's what has happened in BIOL 101.002 (SPRING 2017) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Exam 1 #7  (2/14/17 4:22 PM)

Could someone explain why answer choice (b) was the correct answer for #7 on Exam 1? I thought that the study would call for a wider sampling than just five-year old boys.

7. Which of the following studies would best test the hypothesis that genetically modified (GM) corn does not cause digestive disease?
a) Survey 100,000 people who have digestive disease to find out if they eat GM corn or not.
b) Follow five- year old boys that eat 1/2 cup of corn per day for three years. One group of 50 boys will be given GM corn and another group of 50 boys will be given non-GM corn. Neither group knows what kind they have. Measure incidence of digestive disease.
c) Record the incidence of digestive disease in the entire population of the United States before GM corn was invented and after it was introduced into the American diet.
d) Follow 10,000 women who report eating GM corn and 10,000 men and women who report not eating GM corn for 10 years. Measure incidence of digestive disease.
