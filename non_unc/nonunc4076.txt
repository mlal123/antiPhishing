Question #14 on 12.2

The problem is:=C2=A0Ropes 3 m and 5 m in length are fastened to a holiday =
decoration that is suspended over a town square. The decoration has a mass =
of 7 kg. The ropes, fastened at different heights, make angles of 52=C2=B0 =
and 40=C2=B0 with the horizontal. Find the tension in each wire and the mag=
nitude of each tension. (Use g =3D 9.8 m/s2 for the acceleration due to gra=
vity. Round your answers to two decimal places.)

I got the correct answer for the magnitudes of the 3m and 5m ropes, but I'm=
 having trouble with the tensions. The solution on WebAssign says that you =
can get the tensions by solving=C2=A019e3eb14bf174d1ab6de7b93c47ea687.dvi



T3 =3D =E2=88=92 |T3| cos (52=E2=97=A6) i+ |T3| sin (52=E2=97=A6) j and=C2=
=A0T5 =3D|T5|cos(40=E2=97=A6)i+|T5|sin(40=E2=97=A6)j; however, when I compu=
ted the tension for T5 using this formula and the magnitude I already found=
 (which WebAssign marked as correct), I got=C2=A032.37i+27.16j, which WebAs=
sign marked as incorrect. Any ideas on what I might be doing wrong?? Is it =
possible that using the magnitudes rounded to two decimal places in my comp=
utation of the tension is not accurate enough for WebAssign?

Thanks!
