Problem Set 1 Grading on Sakai

Last time I checked with the TAs (which was a few months ago) they told me that Sakai had some grading problems for Problem Set 1.
Are there any remaining technical issues for the problem set 1 grades?
Mine still shows up as no grade for problem set 1.

Thanks!
