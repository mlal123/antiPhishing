Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting error in lab 4 ex 2  (9/29/16 2:51 PM)

So out of the three tests for ex 2 in lab 4, two and three pass perfectly w=
ith the self check script.

Test one failed in the script, so I used the diff command for ex2result1 an=
d ex2out1 to see what the matter was, and the error I received there was th=
at the binary files differ. =C2=A0It literally says "Binary files ex2result=
1 and ex2out1 differ".

I'm very confused about this because if there was a problem with the compil=
ation which is the only thing I can think of that would cause this kind of =
error, wouldn't it do that for all of the tests?

Not sure how to go about fixing this error.

ard time aligning my array values with the sample output
