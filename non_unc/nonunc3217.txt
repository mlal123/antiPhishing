Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

LocalChecker issue  (10/26/16 4:35 PM)

My laptop was sent to repair so I'm using Eclipse on Virtual Machine to do Assignment4. When trying to run a test, usually we drag and drop the LocalChecker into the project. However, the Eclipse on Virtual Machine does not support this drag and drop action. So I had to import the LocalChecker into package (I assumed this is equivalent to drag and drop), but a whole lot of crap showed up in the package explorer and I cannot see the score after the test is completed. Instead of drag-and-drop, is there another way to put the the LocalChecker in the project without messing up the package explorer? Thanks!
