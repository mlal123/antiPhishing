Here's what has happened in COMP 435 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
unable to see the password in wireshark for task 1b  (12/06/17 1:17 AM)

I have tried looking in both the eth13 and lo interfaces but I cannot seem to find the password for task 1b. In lo none of the packets appear and in eth13 when i right click to follow the tcp stream none of the packets seem to be what I am looking for. Could anyone help me with this?
