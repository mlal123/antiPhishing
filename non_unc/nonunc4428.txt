Mangza, 

I've noticed you haven't yet accepted your membership into The National Society of Collegiate Scholars (NSCS). As the Director of Member Engagement at NSCS, I know the tremendous value joining NSCS will offer. This is a reminder that you still have three days left to confirm your membership. When you do, you will be able to participate in the following NSCS-exclusive opportunities:

* New Member Award: This year, NSCS will award 50 $1,000 New Member Awards to outstanding new members across the United States. This prestigious award can be used to help defray the costs of education.

* New Member Induction Ceremony: After you confirm your NSCS membership, you will be officially welcomed into NSCS at the New Member Induction Ceremony scheduled to take place in the fall. Not only will you be formally inducted into the Society, but you will also receive your membership pin and connect with fellow NSCS members at your school.

* Member Benefits: Year round, you get access to exclusive benefits that are only available to NSCS members. In addition to scholarships and leadership opportunities, NSCS member benefits include discounts with companies such as GEICO, Lenovo, and more!

Opportunities like these, combined with other events hosted by your NSCS chapter at UNC-Chapel Hill, will expand your network locally and across the nation.
