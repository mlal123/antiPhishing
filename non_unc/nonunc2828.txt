Unable to log into classroom.cs.unc  (9/28/16 12:05 AM)

I have been trying to log into the classroom.cs.unc and I am able to enter in my password but after that the terminal just seems to stop and not do anything. Is this because the server is down or is it an isolated issue?

Thanks for the help!

Missing Questions on PS2 pdf  (9/28/16 12:46 AM)

When I opened PS2 pdf on Sakai, there are large spaces between some questions with some missing. For instance, my PS2 document does not show Problem 1 question d. Additionally, I see some questions about Problem 2 part G, but on my pdf, problem 2 only has parts a) and b) and then there is a large blank space until Problem 3 begins.

Also, there are still blanks for these answers where we submit the answers on Sakai.

Is anyone else getting the same thing?
