Assignment 2 Grades Released

Class,=C2=A0Assignment 2 grades are released on Sakai. Below is the rubric =
we used.=C2=A0

10 Pts: Hamming
        8 test cases were ran, and a proportional amount of points were ass=
igned.

35 Pts: Pre-Image
        - 5 if there is a trivial error resulting in the incorrect output
        - 5 for exceeding time limit
        - 15 Incorrect output
=09
35 Pts: Collision
        - 5 if there is a trivial error resulting in the incorrect output.
        - 10 If the implementation is implemented as a preimage attack.
        - 15 Incorrect output

10 Pts: Submitted report
        -5 for a question not filled out.=20
        -5 If pre-image is easier than collision

10 Pts: string1.txt and string2.txt matches
        - 5 Minor error, a few bits off the mark.	- 10 For many bits off th=
e mark, or the file remain unchanged.=20=20

The most common error=C2=A0we saw were minor errors, which outputted extran=
eous items (such as the count). The second thing we saw was implementing th=
e collision portion of the assignment like pre-image. For example, pre-fixi=
ng a hash and rerunning your pre-image code. The effective solution for col=
lision is to add each hash to a dictionary, so when you generate another ha=
sh you compare it to all previous values in constant time.=C2=A0 This appro=
ach should be separate from pre-image. Some more info can be found here:=C2=

A sample solution I made for collision can be found here:=C2=A0https://gist=

Avg score: 86.5

Expected number of pre-image computations: 16.7 million.=C2=A0
Expected number of collision computations: 1.25*sqrt(2^{# of bits in hash})=
 =3D 1.25*sqrt(2^24) =3D ~5120 (Source:=C2=A0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/=
Birthday_attack#Mathematics)=C2=A0

I gave style comments where I saw fit, but due to time limitations we could=
n't reach out to everybody.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0would like a code review where yo=
u didn't get one, feel free to see one of us.=C2=A0
