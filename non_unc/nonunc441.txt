Your classmate posted a new Question.=20

The very last input after K

To display "Game Over",=C2=A0should I need to "Type any number to continue"=
 as I did in the previous two iterations, or should my program automaticall=
y tell the user "Game Over" after the 3rd and final iteration is completed?=
 How I have it set up right now is that on the final iteration it will tell=
 you "The End. Type any number to continue." and then once the user enters =
any input it will display "Game Over." This doesn't seem correct to me. Sho=
uld it just terminate automatically?
