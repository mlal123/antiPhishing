Students must have health insurance.

The UNC System requires that eligible students must have health insurance. You may be covered under your own insurance plan or you may choose to enroll in the UNC System's Student Health Insurance Plan, Student BlueSM from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina.* Student BlueSM is health insurance coverage you can count on - so you can stay focused on your education.

Eligible students who wish to enroll in Student BlueSM coverage for Fall 2015 are encouraged to submit an enrollment request no later than September 10, 2015 to ensure timely receipt of insurance ID cards. Students who are enrolled by default will not receive ID cards until after the deadline has passed.

IMPORTANT: If you are deemed eligible by your university and fail to proactively enroll or submit an approved waiver to avoid enrollment, you will be enrolled by default in this plan.Default enrollment does not occur until approximately 3-4 weeks after the September 10, 2015 deadline.

Students are automatically charged for Student BlueSM coverage.

Need to waive Student BlueSM coverage?

	- If you have creditable health insurance coverage, you must waive the Student BlueSM coverage and provide proof of your coverage each university semester. The charge will then be removed.
	- If you're already covered under another Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina plan and wish to keep it, you'll still need to waive the Student BlueSM coverage each university semester, or you will be charged for it.
	- If you do not receive an approved waiver, you will be enrolled in Student BlueSM coverage by default following the September 10, 2015 deadline.**
No longer going to be a student after July 31, 2015?

	- The Spring/Summer 2015 coverage period for Student BlueSM ends July 31, 2015. Please take timely action to secure other means of health insurance to avoid any gaps in coverage. You may review healthcare.gov for individual health insurance options.
