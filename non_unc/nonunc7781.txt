I'm sure I could remember most content like dynamic programing, MST... =C2=

ning proper homework and grading them. Videos are great. The Linear program=
ing chapter in the book is good=C2=A0on algebraic side, yet it fails to cle=
arly explain geometric intuition behind it. Videos on linear programing cou=

n, which is supper important in practice.
