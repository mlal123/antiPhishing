Worst Case to locate item in a List

In 10 in the practice questions, why is the worst case to locate an item in a list O(log(N))? shouldn't it be O(N), depending upon the type of list it is and how you search through it? I think O(log(N)) is the best case, not the worst case... If someone could explain that I'd appreciate it. Thanks!!
