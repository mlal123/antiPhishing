Nucleic Acids  (2/08/17 10:57 PM)

As part of the 4 classes of macromolecules, nucleic acids is included in the sections of the textbook we were assigned. However, on the GRQ's, there are only two questions about them and both ask about DNA only. Will we need to know additional information about nucleic acids? Like their structure/function and stuff?
