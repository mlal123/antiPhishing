Which equation and when?  (4/08/17 9:21 PM)

Hi
I am doing the 16.2 webassign and noticing that every question asking to ev=
aluate the line integral involves f.dr,
so I was wondering how do we know when to use f.dr and when to mulitple f(r=
(t) with the |r'(t)|

Problem 19 Section 15.7 Canzani  (4/08/17 9:37 PM)

In this problem, and in general when calculating triple integrals when the =
bounds of integration are not exactly specified, why did they choose to fir=
st find the intersection of the plane 2x + y + z =3D 4 and the xy plane? Is=
 there a reason that they chose to go that route instead of finding the int=
ersection of the given plane and the xz or zy plane? If it doesn't matter w=
hich plane you use to find the intersection, could you calculate the same e=
xact integral using three different sets of bounds of integration (and stil=
l get the same answer)? I'm assuming that's true but I wanted to make sure.=
 Thanks!
