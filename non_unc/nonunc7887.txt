Hi Mangza,

I got a note from UNC indicating this info is needed in mid Jan so we've
got a couple of weeks to get it submitted.

Shaw and I are working to fill in the info needed.

Wanted to check and see what you've planned for commuting to the office.
If you have a car, we can provide you with a fob for free parking in the
garage behind our 1 Almaden building.  If not, then we can provide you a
monthly stipend to use for a Clipper Card which you can use to ride the
train from Menlo to San Jose.

Wanyi Chen is another UNC Honors student who will be interning at Swim with
you this Spring.  I am going to check on her commute plans too and perhaps
if either of you has access to a car, you can carpool together.

Please let me know what you are planning.

Thanks, Rusty
