The three most important lessons/observations I've made in my time here wou=
ld be to maximize time, take big risks, and be eager to learn.
Time: it felt like people were always doing things, productive things. This=
 made me reflect hard internally on myself. I used to care more and used to =
do things but for the past several years I've been lazy and have not being a=
s productive with my time as I should have been. Being surrounded with peopl=
e who are motivated as well as hearing stories from our visits has really re=
-lit a fire within me to be more productive with the limited time.
Risks: From everyone we've met to on our Friday visits to my boss all I've =
heard is to take risks. What I've taken away from them is that risks need to=
 be taken if you ever want to make significant differences in your life. And=
 I've taken that to heart with me as I pursue further into my future as an e=
ntrepreneur.
Eager to learn: The biggest thing I've learned in my time in Silicon Valley=
 has been that I don't know anything. There's so much to know and learn in t=
his world, so many fascinating, cool and important things in the world. It h=
as made me extremely excited to explore and find new solutions to the many p=
roblems that exist in this world.

Buck and I had dinner last night and discussed the projects and reports you=
 are presenting today and tomorrow.  There is substantial overlap in what I =

I wish I could sit in on your presentations.  I have meetings all morning a=

initial presentations, not the Q&A.

I=E2=80=99m also cognizant that we took advantage of the opportunity to schedule =
several high caliber site visits on days that had been reserved for class ti=
me.  I feel I owe you more teaching time, particularly on investment capital=
