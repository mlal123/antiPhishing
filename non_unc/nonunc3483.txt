Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

partial credit on labs  (11/14/16 2:54 PM)

Do we get partial credit on labs? For example if 2 out of 10 outputs are wr=
ong but the rest are correct do we get partial credit for what's correct or=
 is the entire thing wrong?

Problem Set 3 Grading Error on Question 23 (or Problem 5)  (11/14/16 5:32 P=
M)

It seems that a slight error on question 23 of Problem set 3 was not fixed =
after the grading was finished.

For the one where the input is A:1, B:1, C:1, D:0, E:1, F:0, the answer key=
 says that the Y is 1.

However, A, B will pass on the NAND as 0,=C2=A0and C, D will pass the NXOR =
as 0.
The since two inputs of the OR gate are both 0,=C2=A0the U1 outcome will be=
 0.hus the final AND gate in U5 as 0.
Since one of the inputs of the final AND gate is 0, the result for U5(=3DY)=
 will be 0.

It would be great if one of the TAs could check on this question.
Thank you!
