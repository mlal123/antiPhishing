and experiences relevant to the position desired and career goals, and iden=

 and
explore job options, understands and can take the steps necessary to pursue=
 opportunities, and understands how to
self-advocate for opportunities in the workplace.

management is a journey, not a destination. As your interests change over t=
ime
you may need to develop new skills to help get you to the next stage of your
career. Be open to change and life-long learning and all that goes with it.=
