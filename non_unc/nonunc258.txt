Lab 1 - Print Line Statements  (9/02/15 5:30 PM)

After entering each line of code, I used a print line statement to make sure the code was correct. Is it okay if I leave this in the program when I turn it in, or should these print line statements be removed? I know we used them in class, but it wasn't specifically mentioned in the description of the Lab 1 assignment so I wasn't sure. Any help is appreciated!
