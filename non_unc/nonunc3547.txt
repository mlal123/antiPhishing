Q1  (11/19/16 5:59 PM)

A component has an output Y, and two inputs A and B, a timing specification=
, and the following functional specification: Output Y is =E2=80=981=E2=80=
=99 if and only if the values of A and B have been equal throughout the las=
t one second. True or False?: This specification describes a combinational =
component.

Is there is a cycle or feedback from the output? I did not notice any, so I=
 don't see how this is sequential.

Asynchronous event handling in mips?  (11/19/16 6:35 PM)

How does a mips program detect an asynchronous event such as i/o or excepti=
on handling? Are there flags in the circuits that are triggered by certain =
events, and before the next word from pc is read, are these flags checked t=
o move onto vectored interrupts?
