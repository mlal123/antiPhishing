Gradescope Help

Hey guys. i'm trying to submit my work for gradescope as a pdf. My PDF has around seven or eight pages in one PDF file, but when I submit to gradescope, it only seems to use the first page as my only submission. I wake up early so I'm heading to bed soon, it's difficult for me to stay up that much later just to submit some work. Anyone have some fix for this?
