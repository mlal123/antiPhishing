Help with Re-Downloading Eclipse?  (9/19/15 6:47 PM)

My pc broke down, so I'm using a Mac OSX version 10.9.5--but I am having trouble downloading Eclipse onto the mac. I can't seem to find the right version of Eclipse to download, and I can't find the details about downloading Eclipse on the website. Any help? :)
