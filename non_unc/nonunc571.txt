Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

Lab 2  (10/16/15 11:56 AM)

Why do the instructions tell us not to tell the user that they entered a number that is not a multiple of 3 but the rubric asks that we do notify the user?

Lab2  (10/16/15 1:14 PM)

If the user inputs a number outside of 1,2, or 3, do we need to re-loop the program to let the user input a recognized number? Or can we just end the program following the print line "Unrecognized option"?
