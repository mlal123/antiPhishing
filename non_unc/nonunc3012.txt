Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

Indirect addressing mode slide clarification in code  (10/10/16 7:16 PM)

I'm reviewing the slides for addressing modes and I was hoping someone migh=
t be able to help me understand what's happening in the code on this one (l=
ecture 6b, slide 9):

In the MIPS code (and the equivalent in C), from what I can tell, this is h=
appening:
1. x is initialized to 10
2. The address of x=C2=A0is loaded in to $2
3. The value 2 is stored in $3
4. The value at $3 (now 2) is stored at the address of x

Is that right?

anything from problem set 2, like there's no where for me to click and go o=
ver all the questions. Is this a problem for anyone else and how could i ge=
t it resolved.
