"Could not find Color() constructor"

All of my tests in part 2 pass except for one, which is telling me that I don't have a Color() constructor. I'm confused because I didn't see anything in the instructions that said to create a color constructor. I thought it was this:

public Color (double red, double green, double blue) {
this.setRed(red);
this.setGreen(green);
this.setBlue(blue);
}

Is there something else that I need to add?
