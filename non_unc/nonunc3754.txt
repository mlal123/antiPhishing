Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Problem Set 5 and late work in general  (12/06/16 2:06 PM)

When is the last date to submit?

Bottom 3 bytes  (12/06/16 2:43 PM)

Assume there's a line within the cache that looks like this:

Tag =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Data
2016 | 17 | 18

The last 5 digits of the binary version of 2016 are=C2=A000000.

Now, if a location with last 5 digits "00100" is called and we're using dir=
ect mapping, does the 2016 get evicted and replaced by=C2=A0the location wi=
th the new tag ending in "00100"? I wasn't sure if the last 5 digits of the=
 Tag have to be exactly the same for a line to be evicted/replaced.

transistor logic symbols  (12/06/16 2:51 PM)

Hey so I just want to make sure I understand the symbols behind our transis=
tor logic

A&B =3D=3D A^B =3D=3D AND correct??? And XOR is given by the + with a circl=
e around it??? I'm just looking at the ALU function logic in one of the pow=
erpoints and it's a little confusing. Thanks!

Which bits to use as line numbers in PS5 Part 2 set associative cache?  (12=
/06/16 3:02 PM)

In a previous question (@486), Professor Lastra confirmed that we should be=
 using the second 2 bits of an=C2=A0address to determine the line number in=
 the cache and the first two bits for the specific byte of data at that add=
ress (which makes sense).=20

However,=C2=A0the associative cache given to us=C2=A0on the problem set use=
s the first 3 bits to address the byte of data (which doesn't make sense if=
=C2=A0each tag only represents 4 bytes of data, not 8) and the next 2 bits =
to represent the line number. I'm confused as to which we should be using, =
since it will make a difference in where our tags go in the cache.

What is the reasoning for question 9?  (12/06/16 3:05 PM)

In how many cache lines can the byte at 1013 be stored in a 2-way set assoc=
iative cache?

Symbols in the "Forwarding" slide  (12/06/16 3:40 PM)


What do the following abbreviations mean?

Shouldn't the 5 stages be: instruction fetch, decode, execution, memory and=
 write back?

2 Way Cache Question  (12/06/16 3:58 PM)

For the 2 way associative cache are we supposed to get our first tag from b=
its 3 and 4 or bits 4 and 5? The tags do not seem to match if you use bits =
3 and 4

2-way cache question  (12/06/16 4:09 PM)

It has been confirmed on various occasions that we should be using bits 3 a=
nd 4 to determine the line number for the two-way cache question. However, =
the original cache has addresses in locations that correspond to using bits=
 4 and 5.=C2=A0

Even starting with the given cache, we could just use bits 4 and 5 to repla=
ce the data as accessed, but what should we do if an address that is access=
ed appears in the cache but in a line different than computed from its addr=
ess? Do we continue to treat it like a miss and therefore replace a differe=
nt value, which would duplicate the address in the cache, or treat it like =
a hit because it appears in the cache and do nothing to modify the cache be=
yond keeping track of the most recently modified line?

------------------------------------------------------------
Structural vs Data vs Branch hazard  (12/06/16 4:15 PM)

My understanding is that:

Structural hazard can be avoided by making all instructions have the same n=
umber of clock cycles;
Data hazard can be avoided by forwarding or stalling;
Branch hazard can be avoided by stalling.

So if we know a CPU has both the forwarding and number of clock cycles take=
n care of, all of the rest of the hazards can be avoided by stalling. Is th=
at correct?

Thanks!

Meaning of "no partial credit"  (12/06/16 4:16 PM)

Problem Set 5 says no partial credit would be awarded - does that mean if a=
nything in Part 1 goes wrong, we lose point for the entire Part 1? Or does =
it mean that if a single entry in the table goes wrong, we just lose point =
for that single entry?
