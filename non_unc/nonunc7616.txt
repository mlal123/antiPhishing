Here's what has happened in COMP 435 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Python argument for task2.a, task2.b, and task2.c  (12/02/17 4:00 PM)

Is the requirement just sending a random packet to a random destination ip=
=C2=A0address from a random source ip=C2=A0address(preferably=C2=A0within y=
our VM LAN)?
Should there be argument(s) for the two python program, indicating the sour=
ce and destination address, or is it something that can be coded in the pro=
gram?

------------------------------------------------------------
Python version related to HW5  (12/02/17 3:39 PM)

For previous HWs the required python version was python3,=C2=A0but for HW5 =
the provided link for Scapy is for python 2.x, and getting Scapy 3 for pyth=
on 3.x proves to be rather difficult since pip3 is difficult to install on =
ubuntu 12.04. Is the python version requirement still in place for this ass=
ignment?
