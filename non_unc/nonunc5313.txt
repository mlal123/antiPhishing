16.7 - Surface Integrals #9

(Sorry for the inconvenience.=C2=A0Some exponents are formatted as subscrip=
ts.) I am having extreme difficulty evaluating this problem's integral:=C2=
=A0=E2=88=AB=E2=88=ABS((zexy)i+(3zexy)j+(xy)k)=E2=80=A2dS=C2=A0where S is g=
iven by parametric equations x=3Du+v y=3Du-v z=3D1+2u+v, 0=E2=89=A4u=E2=89=
=A42 and 0=E2=89=A4v=E2=89=A41. I let D=3D{(u,v)|0=E2=89=A4u=E2=89=A42, 0=
=E2=89=A4v=E2=89=A41}. And I rewrote the integral as 2=E2=88=AB=E2=88=ABD((=
3+6u+3v)e(u2-v2)+v2-u2)dA. Is this the wrong integral? Is there a coordinat=
e system which will make it easier to solve if it is right? It seems to me =
that solving this integral would entail finding the anti-derivative of eith=
er eu2 or e-v2, which leads me to believe I have made some sort of mistake =
because=C2=A0I have never seen the antiderivatives of those functions befor=
e.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
