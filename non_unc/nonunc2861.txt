Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Lab4 Ex5

My output places the answers (1! = 1 etc) on the line after the input instead of the same line. For example:
Enter a number: (input)
1! = 1
Enter a number: (input)
2! = 2
...
as opposed to:
Enter a number: (input) 1! = 1
Enter a number: (input) 2! = 2

Does anyone know what the problem might be? There is not a newline statement after the printf for "Enter a number" or after scanf, nor is there one before the output printf. Note that I'm using a function that is called upon, so would that make a difference?
I look forward to any input!
