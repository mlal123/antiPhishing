Buck and I had dinner last night and discussed the projects and reports you=
 are presenting today and tomorrow.  There is substantial overlap in what I=
 planned as the final take-home exam for 327H.  Rather than have you transl=
ate your entire presentation to written form, could you please send me the =
material you are presenting with a cover note summarizing your three most i=
mpactful observations / lessons from the semester.  This can be in any form=
at you desire.  Please send by Friday, May 4. =20

I wish I could sit in on your presentations.  I have meetings all morning a=
nd am flying to Chapel Hill tomorrow.  I do plan to stop by this afternoon =
at the end of class.  If there is a way for someone to video each pres in a=
 sufficiently low-res file to be shared via Dropbox, please do so.   Just t=
he initial presentations, not the Q&A.

I=E2=80=99m also cognizant that we took advantage of the opportunity to sch=
edule several high caliber site visits on days that had been reserved for c=
lass time.  I feel I owe you more teaching time, particularly on investment=
 capital and deal structures.  I would be happy to offer two or three oppor=
tunities to engage further in discussions on those topics, either in person=
 or through conference calls.  I know some of you are traveling.   Could yo=
u please talk as a team and recommend your preferred approach?  These obvio=
usly aren=E2=80=99t required, but I=E2=80=99m happy to do it if there is in=
terest.
