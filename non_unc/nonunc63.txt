INFORMATIONAL MESSAGE FROM ALERT CAROLINA:  Update on Notifications for Arm=
ed Robberies

Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:

We write to share updates about the communication problems that came to lig=
ht Wednesday night with our Alert Carolina emergency notification system re=
garding two armed robberies on campus.

The two students who reported those related incidents near Aycock Residence=
 Hall shortly before 11 p.m. were not physically injured. They have had ful=
l access to campus support services, and we continue to monitor their needs=
 as Summer School winds down.

Part of our notification system worked exactly as planned. The ranking Depa=
rtment of Public Safety officer in the field correctly activated the sirens=
 once officers confirmed there was a significant threat based on the inform=
ation provided by the victims. All six sirens sounded in a timely manner an=
d broadcast short pre-recorded voice messages about the initial threat and =
the =E2=80=9Call clear.=E2=80=9D Officers also quickly secured the crime sc=
ene and set up a perimeter in close coordination with Chapel Hill police.

Unfortunately, the additional communications that should promptly follow a =
siren activation =E2=80=93 including a text message to registered cell phon=
es, an email and posts on official University social media accounts =E2=80=
=93 were delayed. That caused confusion about the status of the safety thre=
at and unnecessary concern for people who were on or near campus.

Chancellor Folt has made it clear to us that such a breakdown is unacceptab=
le. We wholeheartedly agree and, on behalf of the University, sincerely apo=
logize to the campus for Wednesday night=E2=80=99s response. An after-actio=
n review team met promptly on Thursday morning. They reviewed everything th=
at happened and determined that two human errors, compounded by a glitch in=
 the communications process, caused this problem.

We assure you that the University is taking immediate steps to correct thes=
e issues so that such errors do not happen again. We are refining and impro=
ving how the appropriate staffs communicate with one another and train to r=
espond to a potential emergency on campus.

Nothing is more important to our University than the safety of our students=
, faculty and staff. We will have an opportunity to test these improvements=
 as part of regularly scheduled emergency preparedness drills and exercises=
. On August 26, we will conduct the annual fall semester siren test, which =
will include sending text messages and emails to the campus community. This=
 is an important opportunity for students, faculty and staff =E2=80=93 espe=
cially those new to campus =E2=80=93 to make sure they are familiar with em=
ergency procedures. You can find a wealth of information, including safety =
tips and safety-related resources available on campus, at http://alertcarol=
ina.unc.edu.

Carolina is committed to constantly re-evaluating all procedures related to=
 campus safety based on actual events, knowledge gleaned from training exer=
cises and best practices in higher education and law enforcement. We will k=
eep the campus community informed about these issues and will post updates =
as new information is available on the Alert Carolina website.

Earlier today, Chapel Hill police, UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke University issu=
ed a joint call for help from our respective communities in identifying sus=
pects in multiple cases of similar robberies, including one reported early =
this morning at Duke. We strongly encourage anyone who might have informati=
on that could help these law enforcement agencies solve these crimes to com=
e forward.  For details, refer to http://alertcarolina.unc.edu.

Sincerely,

About Informational Messages: The University sends an Informational Message=
 to inform the campus community about a situation that is not an emergency =
but is expected to be of significant interest to the campus. An Information=
al Message is one of three tiers of communication under the University=E2=
=80=99s revised emergency communications plan. Emergency Warning refers to =
a siren activation for a significant emergency.  And a Timely Warning is is=
sued if there is a continuing danger AND notification will not compromise l=
aw enforcement.
