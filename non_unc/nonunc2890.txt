Assignment 3  (10/02/16 10:21 PM)

If an array position is null would that have a lower priority or higher pri=
ority than an array position with an EntryPair?
Also for the EntryPair priority is a lower number higher priority or lower =
priority, so in an if statement would 1 have a higher priority than 10?

delMin Bubble down methodologies?  (10/03/16 12:16 AM)

I'm using a bubble-down method for my delMin method. Right now, the last no=
de stamps over the first, then bubbles down the branch it came from -- that=
 seemed to be the method discussed in class from the PollEv question (where=
 does "41" go after delMin) unless I'm remembering incorrectly.

I think my method is working correctly, but I'm getting a different (yet st=
ill heap-order) ordered.=C2=A0
=C2=A0For example, in test three (insert 4, 1, 2; delMin; insert 0, 3, 7; d=
elMin; insert 0). The example output is 0, 2, 7, 4, 3. My output is 0, 3, 2=
, 4, 7.

Did I miss the part of the assignment that specified exactly how to impleme=
nt this? Is this an acceptable method?

Thanks.
