Trouble Submitting to Gradescope

I've been trying since some time last night to login to Gradescope to submit the worksheet, but I seem to be unable. Since the error message has also been "invalid email/password", I've also tried doing password resets, but after giving my email to the reset form I get a 404 Not Found. Anyone else having trouble?
