Dear Students, Faculty and Staff: 
You received this email as part of a TEST of the University???s emergency sirens. The message coincided with the beginning of the siren test. There may be delays in delivery of campus-wide email. In an emergency, we plan to use all available communication methods including email as part of a multi-layered strategy to reach as many people, including those who may not be on campus when a real siren occurs, as quickly as possible. For more information, see alertcarolina.unc.edu.
