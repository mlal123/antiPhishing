**Good Morning and Happy FDOC of Summer Session 1!**
As the child of parents who were teenagers during the Summer of '69, I gr=
ew up with an unusual music taste for an 11 or 12 year old. While other k=
ids had the wonder of Kidz Bop or Taylor Swift running through the headph=
ones of their CD player, my father and I screamed Oingo Boingo's Dead Man=
's Party at the top of our lungs in the kitchen. =

Weird Science was one of my favorite tunes off the classic 1985 new wave =
album and my excitement over the aesthetic of science has continued into =
my adulthood, even if my practical science abilities never advanced past =
"plastic tubes and pots and pans." =
