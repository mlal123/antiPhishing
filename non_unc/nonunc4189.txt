HW 12.5 #12 (b)- Guider  (1/26/17 5:15 PM)

I got the correct point in (a) so I don't understand why my plane equation =
is incorrect.=C2=A0Here is my process:

Find the cross product of the vectors that are multiplied by s and t.

Plug into the equation of a plane with the point I found in part (a) and th=
e cross product as the directional vector. Please help. I am not simplifyin=
g, could that be the issue?
