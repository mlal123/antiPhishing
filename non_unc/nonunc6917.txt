Here's what has happened in COMP 550.02 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
What is stage i in hw4 q4?  (10/23/17 12:50 AM)

As far as I understand it, our array is indexed from 0 to j to i

And the question is asking us to prove the formula that shows the probabili=
ty of needing=C2=A0j=C2=A0swaps to get to... stage i? which I presume to ac=
tually just be i-j? It's the cumulative probability of each e/2^(j-1) step =
is it not?
