Assignment1  (9/16/15 11:11 PM)

In step 2, it says to ask how many points did the Tar Heels score. However, in the example shown at the bottom, the question is "How many points did UNC score in each quarter?" Does it matter if we use Tar Heels or UNC?

Also, after running my program, my output displays "Duke won the game. The difference in points was -2." Is this still okay? (I read the note about ignoring displayed negative numbers, but I still wanted to make sure.)
