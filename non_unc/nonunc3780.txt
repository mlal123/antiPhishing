Loading Larger Constants into Registers  (12/09/16 1:59 AM)

Can anyone explain exactly how to load a larger constant into a register. I=
 understand the basic idea but why do we need to load the constant in separ=
ate parts?=C2=A0

Take for instance 0xABCD1234. Why can't we just put this in a register all =
at once. Why do we have to break it up into 0xABCD0000 + 0x1234?
