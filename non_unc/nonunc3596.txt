Jar for A5Tests that we graded you on

Jorge Fuentes made a great suggestion,=C2=A0 in order to efficiently test y=
our changes to A5 to make it work, I am going to provide you a jar that run=
s the tests ran during grading. So just replace the local checks jar with t=
his, add it to the classpath, and everything else should be fine if you are=
 using the runTests from A5. Here is the jar!

Notes: Testing this with Jorge right now to make sure it works (since I hav=
en't tried this before)...so hang tight if it doesnt work right away.
