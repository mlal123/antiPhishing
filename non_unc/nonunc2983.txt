MIPS: Big-Endian or Little-Endian?  (10/09/16 1:45 PM)

Hi all,=C2=A0

I am a little confused by this because our book says MIPs is big endian on =
page 70, but Dr. Fuchs slides said it was little endian. (ppt 8 slide 4.) t=
he book and the ppt gives slightly different definitions for little vs big =
endian. Can someone give a good example of little vs big endian and clear u=
p which one is correct??? Thank you!

negation shortcut exceptions / pitfalls?  (10/09/16 1:53 PM)

The handy "shortcut" for negating a binary number is to

1. keep the rightmost "1" and everything to the right of that, then
2. compliment everything to the left of that.

My question is, are there any exceptions / cases in which this would not wo=
rk?

PS2 Part 3  (10/09/16 2:49 PM)

On PS2 part 3 (converting decimal, binary to hexadecimal), why are the conv=
erted hexadecimal values in part c and d represented with all 0's in the fr=
ont, indicating a positive number, even though the binary value starts with=
 a 1?=C2=A0

I have a suggestion (Fuchs MWF only)  (10/09/16 2:51 PM)

Since Dr. Fuchs seems to be feeling generous lately this is worth a shot
Because=C2=A0the lab5/recitation period was moved from Friday to the Monday=
 of the following week, there was not weekend hours available to work throu=
gh the lab. Some of us students (including myself) finished the lab up this=
 weekend instead.=C2=A0
It is=C2=A0time efficient to work on the lab after an introduction and tips=
 from the TAs. (this is why=C2=A0some students did not start the lab on the=
 weekend before the delayed lab)

In short, I would be happy if the due date for lab5 was changed to Sunday a=
t 11:59:59pm (or the usual 5pm).

Quiz 5 #4  (10/09/16 3:32 PM)

Hi! Can someone please explain to me why an offset of x is required in the =
first line please? When I read the instructions, it seems like the output i=
n A would be:
A[3] =3D B[x*4].

4)=C2=A0
What is the MIPS code of the following C statement, given that the base add=
resses of A and B are $7 and $8 respectively and x is stored in register $1=
?A[3] =3D B[x]

Correct Answer:
A.=C2=A0
sll $2 $1 2addu $2 $2 $8lw $3 0($2)sw $3 12($7)
