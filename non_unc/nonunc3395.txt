Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Why are Questions 15 and 17 False? No partial credit on 18?  (11/07/16 6:16 PM)

Namely,


Suppose we wanted to fill a register $1 with the value 65535 (0x0000FFFF). Would the instruction addi $1,$0,0xFFFF perform that action?

Suppose we wanted to fill a register $1 with the value -1 (0xFFFFFFFF). Would the instruction ori $1,$0,-1 perform that operation?

MIPS shows both these commands performing the actions stated (though they probably get overridden later since $1 is the assembler temporary).

Why are these counted as false?

Also, my answer for Problem 18 appears correct, but I was given no credit? Was this question graded correctly? (Hopefully this is discussed in @364).

PS3 is not completely graded yet, so you might see a 0 for correct answers.  (11/07/16 6:44 PM)
