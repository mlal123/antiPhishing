Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Exceeds available heap storage  (10/24/16 5:00 PM)

Hello all! I am currently working on exercise 1 of lab7, and have just finished the MIPS assembly version of the code. It works on all of my own values, but then when I attempt to make it work on the sample files, I get an error that reads:


Runtime exception at 0x0000307c: request (16384) exceeds available heap storage (syscall 9)

In my code, I use a system call 9 to allocate memory to an array with a size determined by user input. Does anyone have any advice as to another way to write the code to avoid the above error? Thank you!
