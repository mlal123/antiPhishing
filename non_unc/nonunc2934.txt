Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Build function  (10/04/16 7:08 PM)

Should using the build function for a given array of elements produce the s=
ame result as inserting them into the heap one by one?

Failing on delMin test  (10/04/16 8:29 PM)

Hi friends. I am failing Del Min Test #1 for some reason and I can't figure=
 out where my code is going wrong. This is the one where you insert 5, 4, 3=
, 2, 1. Then you delMin twice. My first delMin is yielding a correct tree (=
based on the animation side and printouts in Playground), but my second del=
Min isn't working quite right. It's yielding "3 3 4" instead of "3 5 4" whi=
ch makes me think something is going wrong with putting the pulled out / te=
mporary value into the hole created by removing the root.

I'm passing everything else and I stepped through it logically but I can't =
figure it out. Was wondering if this was a "duh" moment and someone could p=
oint out where this is falling through the cracks.

Here is a pseudocode version of my code. Not sure how much real code sharin=
g is allowed on Piazza. :)
Decrement size.Delete (set to null) root value at array[1].Pull out and sto=
re array[size+1] as "temp."Set int "hole" as 1.While NOT complete...{##Swap=
 hole and minimum child.if BOTH children of hole not null...	if left child =

e	else		right child is min; swap right child and holeelse if only LEFT chil=
d of hole not null...	swap left child and holeelse if only RIGHT child of h=
ole not null...	swap right child and holeelse NO children of hole not null.=

Build method  (10/04/16 9:19 PM)

I'm still kind of confused on the build method, is it just sorting the arra=
y so that its in proper heap order/structure or is there something else tha=
t the method is supposed to do?=C2=A0
