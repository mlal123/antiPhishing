Condition 1 (beginning at 11 p.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 16)

Current conditions may not pose severe safety risks or logistical challenges, but an event has significant potential to negatively affect - or already is affecting - local area commuting, important campus services, or the efficient functioning of campus buildings and grounds. Employees, faculty, and students should consider their own personal circumstances to determine whether to report late, leave early, or not report at all.

 

Condition 2 (beginning at 6 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 17 until 5 p.m.)

Classes are cancelled and all laboratories are closed. All non-mandatory operations are suspended; only mandatory employees must report to or remain at work. Non-faculty (staff) non-mandatory employees must not report, or must leave campus. These employees must use leave time if not working or can use make-up time subject to applicable rules. Alternatively, and only with supervisor approval, non-mandatory employees may work from home or an alternate site.

Adverse Weather Policy and Background 

Unless a change in operational status is announced, the University always operates on a regular schedule. UNC-Chapel Hill may activate three adverse weather operating conditions:  Condition 1 - Reduced Operations (University is open); Condition 2 - Suspended Operations (classes are cancelled; University is open only for mandatory operations); and Condition 3 - Closure (classes are cancelled; offices and facilities are closed).

Staff employees are reminded of the University of North Carolina system adverse weather policy for all UNC campuses that took effect in 2016.

Key factors include projections about weather and travel conditions on area roads and campus sidewalks, as well as the operating plans of Chapel Hill Transit and other regional transit. Safety is the number one priority when making weather decisions about campus operations.
