Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Clarity for number 6  (10/20/15 1:00 PM)

In my code, it calculates the sum and average every time the program is run=
. =C2=A0The user input of 1 2 or 3 only decides what is going to be printed=
. =C2=A0In the instructions it makes it sound like our program should only =
calculate the sum if 1 is pressed or only calculate the average if 2 is pre=
ssed. =C2=A0(and both for 3) =C2=A0This seams redundant as you would need t=
o calculate the sum all over again if 2 were to be pressed in order to get =
the average. =C2=A0I just need some clarity on number 6.
