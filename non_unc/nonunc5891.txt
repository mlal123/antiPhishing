Hello, my name is Alexis Pihoker and I am a graduate student in the Exercis=
e and Sport Science department.  I am currently recruiting research partici=
pants for a study entitled, =E2=80=9CNutrient timing in resistance-trained =
females=E2=80=9D.
=20
The primary purpose of this study is to examine the effects of timing nutri=
ent intake (either pre-workout or post-workout) of protein-carbohydrate sup=
plementation on body composition, strength, and metabolism, when combined w=
ith six weeks of high-intensity resistance training (characterized by short=
er rest between sets).  For this study, we are looking for resistance-train=
ed women, ages 18-30 years, who are currently participating in resistance t=
raining at least 2 times/hours per week.  Additionally, you cannot currentl=
y be training to compete in a resistance training event, consuming a protei=
n supplement either before or after exercise, consuming creatine within the=
 last month, or taking branched chain amino acid supplements more than once=
 per day.=20
=20
If you participate, you will be asked to sign an informed consent document,=
 as well as answer questionnaires about your medical history, physical acti=
vity, and dietary habits.  This study involves 14 visits over the course of=
 7 weeks.  Strength and body composition testing will occur at the first an=
d last visit.  Body composition will be measured using dual energy x-ray ab=
sorptiometry, while strength testing will be done using leg press, bench pr=
ess, and a series of dumbbell exercises.  Six of these seven weeks will inv=
olve personalized high-intensity resistance training two times per week usi=
ng those same exercises, with metabolic testing occurring at the first and =
last training visits.  Throughout the training intervention, you will eithe=
r consume a pre-workout supplement, post-workout supplement, or no suppleme=
nt- based on the group that you are randomly assigned to (like flipping a c=
oin).  The training supplement is a lactose free milk-based protein beverag=
e.  All testing and training will occur in the Applied Physiology Laborator=
y and Human Performance Center in Fetzer Hall.
Participants will receive free body composition testing, 6 weeks of free pe=
rsonal training, and $50 in compensation.  If you are interested or have qu=
estions, please contact me by either phone or email.
