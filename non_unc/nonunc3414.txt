when trying to export the file, I got a file out of sync warning. However, the ZIP file was creating anyway. Would it in any way affect the grading?

Trouble with RunTests  (11/08/16 11:05 PM)

I just imported LocalChecks and set up my RunTest class. However, when running the test, I get an error message that says "Error: Could not find or load main class SPLT_A4.RunTests." Does anyone know how to solve this? I haven't started writing any code yet, not sure if that's part of the problem?

In Edges and Out Edges  (11/08/16 11:38 PM)

When adding edges is it necessary to keep track of out edges or will just keeping track of in edges suffice?
