Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
distributed BST insert() method logic  (10/24/16 1:02 PM)

Can someone please explain how the insert() method in the distributed BST class work?

The insert() method does not compare the string of the element to be inserted with any element in the tree, so how is it going to decide if it should go to the left or right tree in the next step?
