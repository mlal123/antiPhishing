A0 grades to be release tonight or tommorrow, how to reach out to us about grades if need be

Hey all,

PLEASE read full message before shooting us emails :) There are a lot of you and I am attempting to make the flood of inevitable emails as manageable as possible to make your lives(ie turnaround) and the TA/LA's easier.

The first round of grades for A0 will be released either tonight or tomorrow. If a 0 shows up one of a few things happened:
1. You submitted late, and we will get your grade back to you in the next round of grading.
2. You submitted incorrectly (ie not a zip or auto-gradable zip) please email us
3. You haven't submitted anything yet1

To answer the burning question, YES we will accept resubmissions this time around if you submitted incorrectly. The late multiplier will be that of your original submission (still on time if you originally submitted on time). However, if I notice you have changed around your code between resubmissions, this is a big no-no. Please don't take advantage of our leniency this time around.

If you wish to ask about your grade and/or resubmit due to error please email us at help-comp410@cs.unc.edu with the Following subject line: AX Grade onyen
where X is the assignment number (this one is 0, BST is 2), and onyen is your onyen. If you do not do this I cannot promise your email will be seen. We are trying to have the TA/LA who graded your submission respond to you to help personalize and expedite this process.

The line "I got 100 on the oracle" does not really mean much to us if your code is truly failing the real test cases we ran your code on, as far as contesting grades go. The Oracle is meant to be a guide, not a guarantee of any grade. We do try to put as much as we can in there to help you out but in the end, it is your job to test your own code, ideally beyond the scope of the Oracle.
I will be posting another note on piazza shortly (and potentially on site) a test dump of the actual tests run on your code. You will notice that if you did something like remove wrong, your failed tests will sort of snowball since remove calls are peppered throughout the suite. We have tried to be as lenient as we can in recognizing this and giving you back some points.

All of you should be on piazza and seeing this announcement, if you have classmates who are not please tell them to get on so they can be up to date on logistical announcements such as this (though hopefully this will be the biggest of a small number of them)

Have a great weekend and stay tuned.

-Max
