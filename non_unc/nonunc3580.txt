Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Unreachable Nodes in the wrong order in array  (11/21/16 3:07 PM)

Hey all,

My DiGraph is implemented as an array of nodes that has chained edges to it=
. I currently am having problems putting the node info for the nodes that a=
re unreachable from the sourceNode into the array in the right order. Basic=
ally what I do is go through and put all of the shortestPathInfo objects in=
to the array like we should. I CANNOT put objects that the sourceNode doesn=
't have a path to into the array because there is no connection there. So w=
hen everything is done I have a loop that goes through my graph and checks =
if each node.handled is true or false, and if it is false it makes a new sh=
ortestPathInfo object with totaweight =3D -1.=C2=A0

so for instance the testcase4(islands) looks like this
(0, 0)
(1, -1)
(2, -1)
(3, -1)
(4, -1)
(5, 3)
(6, -1)
mine looks like this:

(0, 0)
(5, 3)(1,-1)
(2, -1)
(3, -1)
(4, -1)
(6, -1)

Can someone give me any pointers on how to fix this??? Thanks
