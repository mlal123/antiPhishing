**Good Morning and Happy Thursday!**

My father is a UNC alumnus and while he was not as fervent as many UNC da=
ds, he did raise me with one solid phrase: Duke Sucks. It wasn't elegant =
and it wasn't particularly mean, but somehow it completely encapsulated h=
is feelings about the school down the road. =C2=A0

I grew up believing that it was unequivocally a fact that Duke Sucks and =
that everyone followed this dogma. it wasn't until elementary school when=
 I met a girl whose father went to Duke and she informed me that apparent=
ly: UNC Sucks.

This obviously shook my entire world and she and I went through school to=
gether constantly battling over which school truly sucked. Both of us hol=
ding to our original belief.

This goes to show that there are always two sides to a coin. So today we =
brought you two sides of issue circling the office for a while: diversity=
 at the DTH.=C2=A0

On a quest to learn more about our mascot, Ramses, and his brother/son/we=
 aren't sure, Ramses Jr., we stumbled upon this frightening photo of an u=
n-named figure visiting the School of Dentistry. This is from a 1984 year=
book of UNC's dental school. We are sorry if this image haunts you.=C2=A0=
