Plan for Reading Day help Wednesday (at least for me)

Hey all. Here is my plan for Wednesday. I intend to be in Sitterson all day grading late A6, regrades etc (and hopefully have time for some gaming ;D). I will ping my location on this thread consistently so you will always know where to find me. Primary focus is to help with those who may be trying to get A6 in last second, people who have questions about any of their hw grades. Secondary focus is helping go over course material for the final. Please note that as it stands this is just me doing this so I will try to be as accommodating as I can be but I can only handle so much volume at one time. So please bear with me.

So look out for location pings on this thread....and I will plan on being available starting noon Wednesday!
