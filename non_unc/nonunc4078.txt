Instructor Kara Ritterpusch posted a new Note. 

PM Hours!

PSA: I will be holding a peer mentoring session TODAY from 12:45-1:45 in the bottom of the Union! I'm wearing an orange vest (it's not the same neon style from class - I just so happen to own another orange vest) and will have a sign up with my name and BIO 101 written. I can help with material, specific topics, or study strategies, but if you want to just come have lunch and chat you are more than welcome :)

Hope to see y'all soon -
Kara
