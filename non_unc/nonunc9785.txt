**Good Morning and Happy Thursday!**

As an out-of-state student, I never had the option to go home during my f=
irst year at UNC. While other kids were getting their laundry done and re=
ceiving home-cooked meals, I was left on campus with the other out-of-sta=
ters or kids from too-far-away North Carolina.

I didn't realize what impact that would have until I was alone most weeke=
nds in September with nothing to do with my not-21-year-old self. Eventua=
lly everyone came to their senses and began to stick around the Hill most=
 weekends, but I had already weathered countless eerily-quiet Saturdays a=
nd Sundays on my own.=C2=A0

So, if you're like me and you're looking for something to do this weekend=
, check out our event guide. I compiled it myself, and I'd classify mysel=
f as an expert in seeking out activities, so you know it comes from a rel=
iable source.=C2=A0

**The Rundown**

**Rodney Hutchison Jr. was the first Tar Heel drafted in the 2018 MLB dra=
ft.** While he was not the last, check out the stats that bought this Tar=
 Heel a ticket to the New York Yankees ( https://sable.madmimi.com/c/1408=

**UNC's Board of Trustees met last week and revoked Bill Cosby's honorary=
 degree.** The meeting also included the swearing in of the new Student B=
ody President and discussions of mental health services at UNC.=C2=A0

**Throwback Thursday**

For today's Throwback we have some old Student Stores advertisements that=
 were featured in yours truly, The Daily Tar Heel. All I can say is ... t=
hey are very ... creative.=C2=A0

This is from a July 1980 advertisement for art supplies being sold at the=
 Student Stores. Not only do I strive to BE this man, but it is always fu=
n to be reminded of a time when you could depict smoking cigarettes in a =
publication.

Throwing it three years further back to March 1977, when Student Stores w=
anted everyone to know they had a full collegiate line of clothing in sto=
ck. I bet that the prices were a little more manageable in 1977 (here's l=
ooking at you, $110 basketball jersey).
