Adept--Assignment 1

Hi,=C2=A0

I've been looking over my code and can't figure out where the bug is. I'm w=
orking on the adept portion of the assignment and have tested my code by in=
putting the example input. For some reason, CorinTucker is always assigned =
a C by my grader. The other two, Carrie Brownstein and Janet Weiss produce =
the correct output. Does anyone know where I should look to resolve this?=
