Dear DTH Readers,

This week UNC received a $1 million award ( http://sable.madmimi.com/c/14=
086?id=3D1035094.29357.1.66de4673d628ed494e6616a24b34d97a ) for excellenc=
e in their recruitment and admittance of students from low-income familie=
s, winning over schools like Stanford and Brown.=C2=A0

Although I try to keep these letters=C2=A0relatively light-hearted, I'm g=
oing to be real with you all. I come from a low-income family, and I woul=
d not be able to attend UNC if not for the scholarship they gave me.=C2=A0=
The opportunity UNC grants its low-income students=C2=A0is a valuable one=
. It's a chance at an education, a better future, and you can't put a pri=
ce tag on that =E2=80=94 not even $1 million.=C2=A0

Celebrating sports is fun, and=C2=A0UNC football definitely has a reason =
to celebrate this week ( http://sable.madmimi.com/c/14086?id=3D1035094.29=
358.1.6ca074fc909033d5e75a37c6778f6041 ). But I encourage readers, curren=
t students, alumni, etc, to also look at=C2=A0what UNC is doing off the f=
ield for low-income students like me, and celebrate that just as much as =
we would a championship trophy.=C2=A0
