Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Absolute Value  (9/12/15 9:29 AM)

6.)=C2=A0=C2=A0Calculate the difference in points between the two teams and=
 store it in a variable called=C2=A0difference. Note: We want only positive=
 numbers for the difference. So, you can either compute the absolute value =
or multiply your difference by =E2=80=9C-1=E2=80=9D if the difference is ne=
gative.

I am not sure how to make the number positive. I tried multiplying the calc=
ulation of dukeScore-uncScore by -1, but it is not working.
