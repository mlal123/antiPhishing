Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:
=20
The University will TEST the emergency sirens and emergency communication p=
rocedures on Tuesday, Feb. 16, at 12:30 p.m. We test the Alert Carolina Sys=
tem and sirens each semester to make sure the equipment and notification pr=
ocesses work as planned.
=20
During the test, anyone outside on campus or near campus likely will hear t=
he sirens. Please note that the sirens are not designed to be heard inside =
buildings or while you are in a vehicle. The sirens will sound an alert ton=
e along with a brief pre-recorded voice message. When testing is complete, =
a different siren tone and voice message will signal =E2=80=9CAll clear. Re=
sume regular activities.=E2=80=9D
=20
Other than these regular tests, the sirens sound only for a major emergency=
 or an immediate safety or health threat such as:
=20
=C2=B7         An armed and dangerous person on or near campus;
=C2=B7         A major chemical spill or hazard;
=C2=B7         A tornado warning for the Chapel Hill-Carrboro area issued b=
y the National Weather  Service; or
=C2=B7         A different emergency, as determined by the Department of Pu=
blic Safety.
=20
The University also sends a text message to cell phone users who registered=
 their numbers in the online Alert Carolina Contact Information page availa=
ble through the ONYEN services website. In an emergency, the University wil=
l post safety-related announcements on the Alert Carolina website, alertcar=
olina.unc.edu, along with updates. A mobile-friendly version of the Alert C=
arolina website can be found at http://m.alertcarolina.unc.edu/

During this siren test, no action is required. We do encourage you to revie=
w the poster, =E2=80=9CWhat You Should Do For An Emergency Warning,=E2=80=
=9D posted in University classrooms, offices, hallways, residence halls and=
 laboratory spaces. It is also accessible online: http://alertcarolina.unc.=
edu/external/content/document/1395/1255639/1/AlertClassroomPoster.pdf . The=
 poster outlines what faculty, staff and students should do when the sirens=
 sound for a significant emergency or immediate threat to health and safety=
.

The sirens are part of the University=E2=80=99s Emergency Notification Syst=
em and an integral element of the University=E2=80=99s communications strat=
egy that uses multiple channels to reach students, faculty and staff, as we=
ll as visitors, local residents, parents and the public. To support that sy=
stem, we follow the Emergency Notification Protocols (http://alertcarolina.=
unc.edu/go/doc/1395/1184039/) in informing the campus community using four =
types of notifications =E2=80=93 Emergency (sirens), Timely Warning, Inform=
ational Messages and Adverse Weather Messages.
=20
Please  note: In a real emergency, we strongly encourage students and emplo=
yees to use the American Red Cross Safe and Well List (http://alertcarolina=
.unc.edu/go/doc/1395/1177155) to let their parents and families know they a=
re okay while keeping cell phone lines open for emergency calls. The Safe a=
nd Well list is especially helpful in communicating with family members who=
 are outside the emergency area.
=20
Thank you.
