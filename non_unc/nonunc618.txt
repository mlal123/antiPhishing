------------------------------------------------------------
multiplesOfThree problem  (10/21/15 5:31 PM)

I think that I've correctly declared my array multiplesOfThree and when I a=
m asking the user to input multiples of three everything seems to work fine=
. =C2=A0But when I am trying to find the sum of the inputs or the average t=
hen eclipse is suddenly giving me an error message and underlining all of m=
y multiplesOfThree arrays and telling me that multiplesOfThree cannot be re=
solved to a variable. =C2=A0Does anyone know what this problem is or how I =
can get around it?
