This Month in Tech: Stanford Tests Swapping Java for JavaScript
---------------------------------------------------------------

In response to market trends and student feedback, Stanford's
Computer Science department launched ( http://www.stanforddaily.com/2017/02/28/cs-department-updates-introductory-courses/?utm_source=codecademy_newsletter ) redesigned versions of their introductory courses this quarter,
swapping out Java in favor of JavaScript, marking the first major
change to their introductory CS curriculum since 2002.

* This new JS course is being piloted as an optional
alternative to the older Java course, not a replacement. The two
languages are very different ( https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Java-and-JavaScript?utm_source=codecademy_newsletter ).
* Prof. Eric Roberts explained that although 15 years ago Java
was intended to be "the language of the Internet," JavaScript has
since taken its place as the dominant language of the web.
* Many people hope that this change will make coding more
attractive to more students, especially those majoring in
business or design.

Although these changes continue to be the subject of much debate
( http://bit.ly/2qy7098 ), whether you prefer Java ( https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java?utm_source=customerio&utm_campaign=2017_05_03&utm_content=stanford ) or JavaScript ( https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript?utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=2017_05_03&utm_content=stanford ), Codecademy has you covered.
