Use PQ in Playground Tests

Hi,

I was messing around with inserting and removing randomly generated priorit=
ies and I figured the easiest way to make sure I was removing in the right =
order is construct a java collections PQ and verify mbh.getMin() =3D=3D pq.=
poll(). =C2=A0You could probably make sure of the ordering by sorting the d=
ataset generated, but implementing a sort algorithm seems more error-prone =
than just using the well tested PQ implementation. =C2=A0So, I'm making sur=
e we can use collections in the playground to verify our own implementation.
