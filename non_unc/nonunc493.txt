Your classmate posted a new Question.=20

Binary/Decimal conversion

On the study guide, there are 0's at the beginning of binary representation=
s. I don't understand what the purpose of these 0's are. Can someone explai=

ght the binary would be 101000 because this would be 2^5 + 0 + 2^3 + 0 + 0 =
+ 0. Is this wrong? If not, why would there be 0's before the first 1?=C2=
=A0
