Testing Part 5 errors  (11/17/15 11:59 PM)

So I was pretty sure I had all of part 5 correct. There aren't any alerts by the line numbers either, however when I try to test it I get these messages in red:

Color Definitions: 11 of 11 tests passed.
Color Semantics: 16 of 16 tests passed.
Image Definitions: 8 of 8 tests passed.
