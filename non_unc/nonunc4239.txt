The problem is asking to find the domain of the vector function and give it=
 in interval notation. I know how to find the domain, I just don't know how=
 webassign wants me to enter in the notation. Can I get an example of how t=
o enter in my numbers properly? I've been doing (a,b),(a,b) but that isn't =
working. Am I missing a logic symbol or something like that?=C2=A0
