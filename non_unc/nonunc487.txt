Study Guide Question 52  (10/02/15 11:13 PM)

Hello,=C2=A0
I am working through the study guide and am stuck on question 52. The quest=
ion reads:

The code below has 3 errors. The object of this program is to take in a str=
ing from the user and print it out 10 times. We will classify an error as s=
omething that will either not allow the code to run (syntax issue), or some=
thing that would make the program not complete the objective laid out.
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner goo =3D new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Please give me a String and I will print it ten=
 times for you!");
        String input =3Dgoo.nextInt();
        for(i=3D0;i<10;i++){
            System.out.println("input");
        }
    }

}

I am mainly confused because I know the=C2=A0third error is=C2=A0with the
String input =3D goo.nextInt( );=C2=A0part, but I don't know how to fix the=
 error and was wondering what the correct way to write the code for that pa=
rt was.
