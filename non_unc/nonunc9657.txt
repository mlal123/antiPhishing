Hello Summoner,

We wanted to place a few wards on upcoming changes to help you understand the choices and controls you have over your data and how we handle your info (yay vision!). We=E2=80=99re updating our Privacy Policy (https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/privacy-policy-update) to give you more transparency into the player data Riot Games collects and uses. As new regulations regarding data protection come into effect in the European Union, we thought it would be good opportunity to provide these protections to our players globally.

These changes will take effect on 25th May 2018. Beyond this date, your use of League of Legends and other Riot services will be covered by these updates.

Here are some highlights of what=E2=80=99s new:

=E2=97=8F Transparency. We know privacy-related issues are important to our players, so we=E2=80=99ve designed our new policies with this in mind. We=E2=80=99re providing more details about the info we collect and how we use and share it. Our updated policies also clarify which Riot Games entity provides the Riot services in your region.

=E2=97=8F Accessibility. We=E2=80=99re also providing additional details on how you can control your personal data including how you can access, change or delete it.

Remember that this update will come into effect on 25th May 2018. By continuing to use our services on or after this date you acknowledge our updated Privacy Policy. Feel free to contact Player Support if you have any questions.

See you on the Rift,
