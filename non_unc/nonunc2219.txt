Dear Mangza,

It has come to our attention that you have not yet confirmed your membership in The National Society of Collegiate Scholars.

I'm writing to you from the NSCS National Office Headquarters in Washington, D.C., to confirm your decision. You are one of the very few 2016 nominees from the NSCS chapter at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that we have not yet heard from. Please advise us of your decision as soon as possible. 

You can join now by visiting http://links.nscs.mkt3303.com/ctt?kn=8&ms=MjU5MDg5NjES1&r=MjAwMDI0ODc0MTg5S0&b=2&j=ODQwNjg2OTMzS0&mt=1&rt=0 and entering the unique login information below:

Username: MLALC59A8M6C
Deadline: August 10, 2016
Lifetime Membership Fee: $95

Mangza, I don't want you to miss out on a great opportunity. However, if you are declining membership, please click here by 11:59 PM on July 7 to officially decline your invitation: http://www.pages03.net/nscs/nscsinvitepreferences/FillOutOptOut?spMailingID=25908961&spUserID=MjAwMDI0ODc0MTg5S0&spJobID=ODQwNjg2OTMzS0&spReportId=ODQwNjg2OTMzS0.

We will then remove your name permanently from our records and inform your chapter officers that you will not be participating in the New Member Induction Ceremony, scheduled to take place this fall.

By now, I'm sure you already know that less than 10 percent of students at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill qualify for membership in NSCS each year, and that you have earned a nomination because of your outstanding academic performance. You also know that membership in NSCS opens the door to new leadership and professional development opportunities that add power to your resume.
Perhaps even more helpful to your future is the vast network of NSCS alumni who have achieved success in fields such as public service, business, healthcare, law, athletics, the sciences, media, and academia.

In this ultra-competitive world, your membership in NSCS gives you a lifetime of advantages in so many ways. At a minimum, don't you owe it to yourself to explore what membership in NSCS can do for you throughout your academic and professional life?

I hope you'll decide to take advantage of the lifetime of opportunities and advantages you'll be getting as a member of NSCS.

Sincerely,
