Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
MIPS uses a 16-bit value as the branch offset for the PC-relative addressin=
g mode  (10/25/16 9:53 PM)

=C2=A0If the offset represents byte addresses, what is range of the branchi=
ng address relative to the PC?

Answer: PC + 4 - 2^17 to PC + 4 + 2^17 - 1

Why would it be 2^17? Shouldn't it be 2^14 because 2^16/2^2 for left shift =
via byte addressing?
