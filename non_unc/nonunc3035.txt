How to test if I freed memory correctly?  (10/12/16 6:47 PM)

Is there a way to tell if I freed up all the memory I was supposed to? I wrote the loop and believe it worked as it was very simple but I don't know how to make sure. Thanks!

Stack Smashing???  (10/12/16 6:55 PM)

I am doing the self check for my lab and am getting this for a few of the files:
Files /home/fuchs/comp411/samples/lab6/ex1out1 and ex1result1 are identicalFiles /home/fuchs/comp411/samples/lab6/ex1out2 and ex1result2 are identical*** stack smashing detected ***: ./ex2 terminated/home/fuchs/comp411/bin/selfchecklab6: line 35: 49642 Aborted (core dumped) ./ex${x} < $infile > $resultfile

Can someone explain what is going on here? It says the files are identical but then I get this, which I assume is bad??? thanks
