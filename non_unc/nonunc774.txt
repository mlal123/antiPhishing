Do I have to call snakeEyes in rollResult?  (11/06/15 1:39 PM)

The assignment says:=C2=A0Note: you MUST use your Boolean methods you imple=
mented earlier for this method, otherwise no points will be awarded for thi=
s part of the assignment.
Does this mean I have to call snakeEyes in rollResult? =C2=A0I think I crea=
ted new boolean expressions but when I test it I get:=C2=A0
Testing Game.rollResult... 0 is for rolledOnceOnlyOnce Expected:true Return=
ed:false ... In 10,000 tries, did not roll one of each outcome?... error(s)=
 :(

Returning a value in a while loop for Holding method  (11/06/15 2:05 PM)

When using a while loop for the Holding method, each of the two primary opt=
ions ( either pressing one to hold or pressing two to roll again) breaks ou=
t of the loop and returns a boolean value, yet the method says that there i=
s an error "The method must return a result of type boolean." How do you re=
turn a result of type boolean after breaking out of the while loop?
