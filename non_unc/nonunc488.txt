Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Late Resubmission  (10/03/15 2:12 AM)

So I submitted assignment 2 before midnight (on time), but realized my most recent changes hadn't saved before I exported and submitted. I fixed everything and resubmitted my assignment, but by that point it was 20 min after midnight. Will I get a maximum of half credit for this assignment since I resubmitted after the midnight deadline?
