
Hi,

Thanks for applying to IBM Extreme Blue!

Your application indicates that you graduate in 2019 or 2020. For Extreme
Blue this year, we're only able to consider December 2017 or May 2018
graduates.

HOWEVER!!! Extreme Blue is only one of MANY IBM internships. You quite
possibly would be eligible for many of those other IBM internships.

Due to the way IBM manages its internships, it is in your best interest to
apply to multiple (>20) postings to improve your chances of selection.

Here are some tips for finding other IBM internships:

   Start at this URL:
   https://krb-sjobs.brassring.com/TGnewUI/Search/Home/Home?partnerid=3D260=
59&siteid=3D5016
   Click on "Advanced Search" near the bottom of the page
   Scroll down to "Country," type in "United States" and click ADD
   Scroll down to "Contract Type" and put a check next to "Internship"
   Scroll to the bottom and click SEARCH

The listings vary from day to day, but today when I do those steps, I see
135 different postings, many of which represent multiple positions. You can
then use the selectors in the left-hand column to further narrow down the
options.

Warmest regards,
