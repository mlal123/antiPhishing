Poster Templates

Below are two templates for 36x48 posters. Choose either one for your poster. From the help@cs folks:
The plotter has one fixed dimension of 36" (with a 1/2" margin), and the other dimension should be greater than 18". The easiest way to print to the plotter is to export the poster as a PDF and copy the file to a flash drive or email it to yourself, then print it from the computer in SN245 (the room with the plotter). The earlier you print your posters, the more likely you are to avoid any issues with the plotter and any long queues.
