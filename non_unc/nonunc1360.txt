Office Hours and wait times

Hey all,=C2=A0
If you're at Office Hours and have been waiting for a while, say=C2=A0where=
 you are in your Digital Hand post. Like, describe which table you're sitti=
ng at or whether you're already in the office, and maybe what color your sh=
irt is or something. This'll help us get to you faster and reduce wait time=
s for everyone.=C2=A0
Also, reminder that if you leave office hours=C2=A0without being helped, pu=
t your hand down before you go. This'll help wait times too, since otherwis=
e=C2=A0if someone's hand went up a while ago we might think they've already=
 left and not=C2=A0prioritize looking for them.
Thanks everyone!
