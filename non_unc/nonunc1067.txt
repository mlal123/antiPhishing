Dear Member of the Carolina Class of 2019,



Attached to this email message is an application for the North Carolina
Fellows Program
,
a cohort-based leadership and self-awareness program offered by Carolina
Leadership Development. We invite you to apply!



*What is the NC Fellows Program?*

The short answer is that the NC Fellows Program is a cohort-based
leadership and self-awareness program that has been present on UNC=E2=80=99=
s campus
for nearly fifty years.



The program can be described as:

   - *Small and Community-focused*: A maximum of 25 candidates are invited
   to comprise each new class.  Each cohort remains intact for the duration=
 of
   their time at Carolina, building a supportive community. Diversity of
   thought, experience, perspective, and background contribute to richness =
of
   discussion, depth of relationships, and stronger community.
   - *Academic*: Program members enroll in EDUC 309 during the fall of
   their sophomore years and EDUC 317 during the spring of their senior yea=
rs.
   - *Co-curricular*: Program members attend Monthly Seminars, the topics
   of which range from current events addressed by faculty & community-memb=
er
   speakers to areas of expertise presented by program members.
   - *Promoting personal growth*: The curriculum pushes its members to
   maximize their potential. There are no requirements to apply, and we
   encourage applications from all first-years, regardless of previous
   experiences. We value inquiry, critical thinking, and humility.
   - *Taking a non-traditional approach*: We are a group of people who want
   better conversations about leadership. The program considers leadership =
to
   be a necessary ingredient in creating positive social change, not an
   end-goal or a synonym for power.
   - *Unique: *Few, if any, other college programs are both curricular and
   co-curricular. Some other unique characteristics of NCFP include:

o    *Inquiry*: Your interests, values, and perspectives matter, both in
the classroom setting and in its various co-curricular contexts.

o    *Critical thinking*: Conclusions that members have reached, or are
trying to reach, are scrutinized and challenged=E2=80=94sometimes vehementl=
y, and
always respectfully.

o    *Developmental intentions*: The curriculum pushes its members to
maximize their potential.

o    *Humility*: In pushing members to maximize their potential, it does
not presume to know how that will be best achieved.  Further, it encourages
members to take responsibility for their strengths and improve upon
weaknesses.

o    *Intellectually honest*: The program encourages its members to develop
various capacities in order to ameliorate the problems they find most
compelling, and to do so based on the best available evidence and data.



*What We Do:*

The Fellows program is unique; it involves both academic (for-credit) and
co-/extra-curricular elements:

   - A compulsory weekend retreat during late March or early April of 2016.
   - EDUC 309, a 3-credit course taken during sophomore fall. The Quality &
   Betterness Seminar for sophomores examines what it means to reflect on o=
ur
   place in the world. Students listen to each other=E2=80=99s stories, cha=
llenge
   predispositions, and discuss difficult issues.
   - EDUC 317, a 1-credit capstone course taken during senior spring.
   - Monthly Seminars.



*The Selection Process:*
