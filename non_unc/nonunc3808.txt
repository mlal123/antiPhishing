Hi Mangza,

We=E2=80=99re always looking for new ways to improve how you create and wor=
k together using Dropbox. That=E2=80=99s why we recently launched several n=
ew productivity tools and sharing features[1] . And there=E2=80=99s more to=
 come. To support these changes, we=E2=80=99ve made a few updates to our Te=
rms of Service and Privacy Policy. Here=E2=80=99s a quick summary. =

 - Privacy Shield. We=E2=80=99re excited to be certified under the EU-U.S. =
Privacy Shield Framework, and have updated our Privacy Policy to reflect th=
is update.
 - Profile visibility. Dropbox may display some of your basic profile infor=
mation (like your name and profile picture) when you=E2=80=99re collaborati=
ng with others.
 - Teammate and team discovery. Dropbox and Dropbox Business team names may=
 be visible to users on the same company or organization domain. Team admin=
s can disable this function[2] . And in the future, this may allow us to he=
lp you find others on the same domain.
 - User terms. We=E2=80=99ve clarified terms like how you can cancel your a=
