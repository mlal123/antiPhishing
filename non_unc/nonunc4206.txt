Your classmate posted a new Question. 

13.1 Reading - Example #5 pg.850 (Canzani)

I don't understand what the book saying for example #5 and why they are writing the equation,
r(t) = (1-t)r0 + tr1
Where did they even get that (1-0)?

The way I am understanding the equation is computer PgoingtoQ and that gets me the normal vector.
And I'll pick that I'm starting from point P, so then I use the r=r0+tV equation and it gets me the same answer.

Am I understanding the equation and did I use the equations correctly?
