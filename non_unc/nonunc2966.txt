Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

Checker returning error I'm unable to reproduce in MARS  (10/07/16 5:09 PM)

Hi there. So I submitted at about 5:00, maybe 5:01 and I'm totally willing to take the necessary 10% deduction, which means I might as well keep working on this issue.

My issue is that the checker is telling me there is an error / mismatch, but when I run it in MARS, I get the exact same output as the provided expected output. The checker is just finding a difference at one line, so it doesn't seem like an issue of newline mismatching, etc. I'm just curious what I can/should do about this?
