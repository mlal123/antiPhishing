Here's what has happened in COMP 435 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 Task 4a Arguement  (10/08/17 7:20 PM)

In the assignment write up, it says:

For example our input may look like:
d7a8fbb307d7809469ca9abcb0082e4f8d5651e46d3cdb762d02d0bf37c9e592
and you would run your program like:
python3 a2_YourOnyen_preimage.py d7a8fbb307d7809469ca9abcb0082e4 f8d5651e46=
d3cdb762d02d0bf37c9e592


But later on it says:

We should be able to run the program like:
python3 a2_onyen_preimage.py filename.txt

Which is a bit confusing since it contradicts.=C2=A0 Are we supposed to tak=
e a file as a parameter and then read a hash from the file or should the ar=
gument contain the whole hash?

Assignment 2 task 2  (10/08/17 5:10 PM)

for the hamming distance program, are binary strings supposed to be the inp=
uts or are we supposed to convert the hashes to binary in the program itsel=

Writeup Confusion  (10/08/17 4:56 PM)

Alright so there seems to be alot of confusion about the write up throughou=
t various posts, I have seen lots of posts on here and a good portion of my=
 friends in the class have at least questioned it. The writeup states

 "What is the average number of trials it took you to break pre-image resis=
tance based on 15 experiments?

But when someone asked about it in an earlier question, @96 , Connor says t=
hat we are supposed to find the avg time.=C2=A0Can a TA or Prof speak to wh=
ich of these we are actually supposed to do? I did what Connor said with th=
e times but according to the writeup it seems like it is looking for avg nu=
mber of hashes generated before it found a collision. Just wanted to get th=
at sorted thanks=20
