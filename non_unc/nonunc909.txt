Colorize  (11/22/15 4:42 PM)

I am stuck on how to implement the color in ColorizeEffect. I have everything else set up, and the filter is working with a hardcoded double value of "0.5" for testing purposes. y problem is that I am unable to implement "this.getColor" because it is of type "Color" as opposed to 'double', and I cannot subtract a color from a double in my "delta" amounts. What am I doing wrong? How can I subtract this color from a double?

Does this section only require one loop? Or will I have to create a loop for each Effect?
