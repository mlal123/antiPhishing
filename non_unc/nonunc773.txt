Quick Note on Formatting Source Code

Hey class,

Sometimes when we grade it is difficult=C2=A0because of format issues or it=
 is hard to read your own code. Please consider formatting your source code=
 before submission. To address this, click the top tool bar Source -> Forma=
t in Eclipse.=C2=A0

This will automatically remove extra "new lines" and white space, and inden=
t it correctly, a great feature to utilize.=C2=A0
