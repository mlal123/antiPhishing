disk vs circle - Canzani

This might be a stupid question but at least in terms of the problems with =
double integrals in polar coordinates, is there a difference between=C2=A0i=
ntegrating a disk vs a circle? E.g. problem #7 in section 15.4: "take the i=
ntegral...... where D is the top half of the disk with center the origin an=
d radius 5." Would the problem be different if it read "circle" instead of =
disk?

Thanks.
