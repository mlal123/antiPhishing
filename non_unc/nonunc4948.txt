PM Today 4:30-5:30

Hey y'all!

Quick reminder that I have a PM session today, 4:30-5:30pm. If you haven't been to one of my sessions before, they're generally small (<5 people, sometimes just 1) and are really flexible. You can bring any questions you have, or just think up some topics you want to go over and talk about in more detail. I'm happy to help in whatever way's best for you.

My session today is 4:30-5:30pm in Genomic Cafe. Hope to see you there!
