Depth First TopoSort

Hey all,

I couldn't finish A5 in time (clearly) and am trying to finish TopoSort met=
hod at this point.=C2=A0
I'd like to use the depth-first search strategy since that is how the TA I =
saw explained it.

depthFirst search method is meant to be recursive, accepting a vertex v=C2=
=A0as a parameter and then calling depthFirst on all of=C2=A0v's children.

My problem is: How can I feed depthFirst a random vertex to start with?

I store my vertices (as values) associated with their labels (as keys) in a=
 HashMap. I haven't found a way to get a vertex at random from this HashMap
