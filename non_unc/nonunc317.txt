Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Assignment 1 Point Input

Should we use a different print ln for each quarter? so like "how many points in 1st quarter" then the int statement and do the same for each quarter for each team or are they wanting us to do one statement that says "how many points did the tarheels score in each quarter and then let the person enter four numbers?

Not sure if that question made sense, but basically I am asking do we need to make four different statements about the scores in each quarter or one big question?
