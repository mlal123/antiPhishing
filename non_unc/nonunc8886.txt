Always know what the CEO is saying publicly about the company. =C2=A0More r=
elevant than historical facts are what the CEO has said publicly in recent =

me of the $60 billion company we were meeting. =C2=A0I corrected it in adva=
nce because I know spelling is not his strong suit.=C2=A0 I would posit tha=
t misspelling the company=E2=80=99s name would have had a tangible discount=
