In class questions  (8/27/15 1:44 PM)

When we were doing the practice questions at the end I got confused. Where =
were we supposed to be declaring those variables? In the console? or the wi=
ndow above the console? When we declare a variable, do we always have to us=
e the System.out.println () to make it print to the console?

Just to confirm: when I open the zipped file I submitted on Sakai, it=C2=A0=
contains two folders: "bin" and "src." The bin folder contains HelloWorld.c=
lass and the src contains HelloWorld.java. When I open the HelloWorld.java,=
 it doesn't open Eclipse, it just shows=C2=A0opens the program in TextEdit =
(I'm working on a Mac). Is this right?

Thanks!
