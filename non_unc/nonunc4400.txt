14.4 HW #Q12

I am confused about this problem. what does it mean, I guess we need to fin=
d out the actual volume of the tin with thickness. (the volume is pi*6^2*14=
 without thickness, then we use differentials to calculate the dV, finally =
we should use pi*6^2*14 minus dV) =C2=A0any suggestions?

"Use differentials to estimate the amount of tin in a closed tin can with d=
iameter=C2=A012=C2=A0cm and height=C2=A014=C2=A0cm if the tin is 0.04 cm th=
ick. (Round your answer to two decimal places.)"
