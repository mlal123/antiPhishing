Here's what has happened in COMP 401-001 on Piazza:

Federico's Office Hours Shifted Friday  (2/16/16 8:12 PM)

Hey guys, I won't be getting to office hours this Friday until 3:45, but I'=
ll stay a bit longer to make up for it

Expressions  (2/16/16 8:16 PM)

Why can't a variable be assigned the result of any expression? (Spring 2015=
 number 8)

Java as a strongly typed language  (2/16/16 8:21 PM)

How does one define "strongly typed?" based on that why is Java not a stron=
gly typed language? I was under the impression that that meant each variabl=
e had a type set to it.... Is java not strongly typed because you can typec=
ast variables?

A4 Adept Constructor Validation  (2/16/16 8:50 PM)

My HorizontalStackPicture and VerticalStackPicture classes inherit from a s=
hared abstract class AnyPicture which implements the Picture interface. The=
 way my code is currently designed, the AnyPicture constructor takes two in=
tegers, "width" and "height", as arguments to its constructor. This design =
creates a problem for the HorizontalStackPicture and VerticalStackPicture c=
onstructors, which the assignment instructs to take two Picture arguments a=
s their only parameters. Because the HorizontalStackPicture and VerticalSta=
ckPicture constructors must call the "super" constructor in the first line,=
 they need to provide that constructor values for "width" and "height", whi=
ch can be done by using the getter methods of the picture references. Howev=
er, the HorizontalStackPicture and VerticalStackPicture constructors must a=
lso take into account the possibility of the Picture references being null.=
 I'm having trouble because it seems I can choose to do one thing or the ot=
her -- call the super class constructor using the getter methods of the Pic=
ture references or test the Picture references for a value of null -- but n=
ot both.

I can see two potential solutions to this problem, but both of them seem to=
 violate the assignment instructions. One potential solution would be to mo=
dify the AnyPicture constructor not to take width and height as arguments. =
This doesn't seem to work for me because as my code is currently designed, =
width and height are the only shared functionality between all Picture obje=
cts that AnyPicture implements. Another potential solution would be to modi=
fy the HorizontalStackPicture and VerticalStackPicture constructors to requ=
ire width and height arguments. However, this violates the form of the cons=
tructor for these two classes that is asked for in the assignment.

Office hours pushed back to 4  (2/16/16 9:27 PM)

I will be holding my office hours from 4-6 tomorrow instead of my regularly=
 scheduled 8-10 because I will be in the hospital.

int x =3D 3; int y =3D 1; switch(x-y)
{ case 0:
x +=3D y;
break;
case 2:
y +=3D 3;
case 4:
x +=3D y;
break;
case 6: x +=3D 3;
default: x =3D 0; y =3D 0; }

how does this work? i'm confused by the case names jumping around.=C2=A0

does it go to case 2 first, and then just go straight into case 4 because o=
f no break statement being present?

Write your own code question - Midterm 2015  (2/16/16 11:03 PM)

For the removeFromLibrary method, could it be a public void method? or does=
 it have to be simply void? i'm not sure how to decide what access modifier=
s to choose in these situations...=C2=A0

I can easily convince myself that "Polymorphism hides object state in order=
 to support abstraction." is false, but I am not sure how to correct this s=
entence. Should it be "Polymorphism hides object state in order to support =
encapsulation"?
