Assignment One "difference" integer

I avoided having the difference be negative by calculating it within else-i=
f statements. So if UNC won, it is calculated as UNC's score minus Duke's s=
core. If Duke won, it is calculated as Duke's score minus UNC's score. Is t=
his an acceptable way to do it? I hadn't even thought about doing an absolu=
te value scenario until I looked back over the instructions. As far as I ca=
n tell it works fine, always outputting a positive difference.=C2=A0
