Python Version

Just wanted to check up on which python interpreter that will be used to gr=
ade. For example, if I write the program on my OS X environment, I use 3.6.=
1. However, 'sudo apt-get install python3' gets me version 3.2.3, which I h=
ave to run using the command 'python3'. However, if I just say 'python' in =
the terminal, it uses version 2.7.3.=C2=A0
