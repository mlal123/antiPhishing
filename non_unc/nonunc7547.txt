Greetings Student Staff Member,  

Please note this survey will close on Friday, December 1.


The feedback and evaluation process are very important elements to the growth and development of our Community Directors. Your observations and experiences help to continue to sharpen or grow the skill and competency levels of our Community Directors having a great impact on their professional experience as well as the student staff experience.

 Before you begin the Evaluation of the Community Director process we ask that you take a couple of moments to reflect on your own personal experiences with your Community Director and base your responses from your perspective to provide a fair view of the Community Director.

In an effort to allow a fair evaluation process of the Student Staff Member and the Community Director it has been determined that Community Directors will not have access or knowledge of their evaluation until December 18, 2017 as Student Staff Evaluations are wrapping up. 

If you have any further questions or general, concerns please feel free to reach out to myself at allave@email.unc.edu or with your designated Region Assistant Director.

Thank you,
