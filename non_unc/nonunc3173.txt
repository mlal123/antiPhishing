Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

Does BST_Node have to have a splay method?  (10/24/16 2:38 PM)

I find it conceptually easier to implement the splay method in SPLT directly, as a while loop would do the job. However, the comment in BST_Node says that the instructor will check if the private splay method is there. Would I lose points if only the SPLT has splay and BST_Node doesn't?

use contains() in insert()  (10/24/16 6:24 PM)

Is it okay if we use contains() method to check if the string to be inserted is already in the tree? Doing so will alter the tree structure IF the string is actually not in the list because the last element will be splayed, so not sure if this is allowed.
