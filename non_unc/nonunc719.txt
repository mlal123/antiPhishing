Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

Assignment 3 winningName?  (11/02/15 8:34 PM)

So I made a new variable to reference the Player object so I could use the =
getName and getScore methods, just like how we did in class. But I keep get=
ting an error message that say the constructor Player() is undefined. I can=
 still reference the methods just fine if I add blank quotation marks withi=
n Player(), but that doesn't pass the test. What do I do? I don't think we =
ever went over this in class.

Curious why enter doesn't work sometimes  (11/02/15 9:19 PM)

sometimes the game will say"Press enter to continue (Press again if it does=
n't work)"Why do you have to press it twice sometimes? Not a coding error o=
r anything I just couldn't identify what makes it do this in GameAux.java a=
nd I was curious.

passed Game.holding test but still incorrect  (11/02/15 9:21 PM)

So I have passed the holding test, but if I run the game, type "3" and get =
the error once and then type "3" again, it rolls the dice again instead of =
prompting for the "unrecognized action!" thing. Any idea how to fix this? I=
 believe it is a problem with my loop..

Assignment 3  (11/02/15 10:08 PM)

In the holding=C2=A0method am getting an error saying the method must retur=
n a type boolean (error is at the method line). =C2=A0However, all of my re=
turn statements do return a true or a false. =C2=A0How do I fix this issue?=
 =C2=A0I am also having the same problem in the winningName method with ret=
urn statements of type string.
