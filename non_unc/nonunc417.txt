Your classmate posted a new Question. 

What should we put for the output in Assignment 2?

There's a lot of possible outcomes for the story, so I figured it would be unreasonable to copy and paste every route in the header. How should we go about it? Should we put a short summary, or copy and paste a sample output (not the one used in the example)?
