Free ReactJS Courses: Upgraded
------------------------------

React is one of the hottest libraries in tech =E2=80=93 powering
Pinterest, Dropbox, Netflix, and more =E2=80=93 and its recent upgrades
made it even better. Now, we've rewritten our React courses to
teach the latest version.

Facebook, the creators of React, say that the ES6 revisions
are essential to learn. Here's why:

* React is now faster to write and easier to read
* The new React syntax is simpler and more similar to vanilla
JavaScript
* The old ES5 standards will steadily be deprecated (made
obsolete)
* Facebook's changes allow for future optimizations, making React
faster

There's never been a better time ever to start learning React:
this year, it topped Stack Overflow's ranking of developers'
most-loved technologies. Get up-to-date =E2=80=93 take our new and
