Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

Where should sum and average be calculated?  (10/19/15 9:27 PM)

I made a for loop in order to create an array of values determined by the user at a length also determined by the user. However, after the loop, I tried calculating the sum and/or average of all of the values of the array, and it seemed to no longer be able to determine these? Should I go ahead and determine sum and average within the loop, and then give them to the user outside the loop when they request it, or is there a way to get the sum and average of the array outside of the for loop?
