References to parent and grandparent node in SPLT  (10/31/16 4:12 PM)

Hey all,

Unfortunately I am running behind here, so please forgive the lateness of t=
his post.

I am trying to write the Splay method in SPLT, and trying to create=C2=A0re=
ferences to the parent node and grandparent node.

In BST_Node class I create references to the parent and grandparent nodes i=
n the insert() method as such:

par =3D this;
gpar =3D this.par;
This works fine since "this" is of type BST_Node in the BST_Node class.
However, if I try to create references to par and gpar in the SPLT class, I=
 cannot say "this" since "this" is of type SPLT.

I don't know of any other way to create the references, which leaves me stu=
ck while trying to write the splay() method. What should I do?

Thank you for your help!

DiGraph Interface  (10/31/16 4:57 PM)

The English spec. for removeNode says "an edge so that each has a unique in=
teger id." but the interface uses longs for all the numbers. =C2=A0Which is=
 correct?=20

Also can we assume that the ids will be clustered close to 0 such that we c=
an use them to index into a reasonably sized array or are=C2=A0we expected =
to handle any possible long value?
