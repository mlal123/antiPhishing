Hi Mangza,

Congratulations again on your invitation to join NSCS! My name is Kacie Perkins, and as a Senior Manager in the Membership Services department here at the NSCS national office (as well as an NSCS alum of the American University chapter), I?ve been lucky enough to speak with prospective members like you about the benefits of NSCS membership.

Between my time as an intern and as a full-time staff member, I?ve worked with NSCS for nearly six years now, and during that time I?ve watched NSCS membership truly change people?s lives. I benefited from NSCS by getting an internship, but I know lots of members who?ve received scholarships, attended leadership training sessions, and added experience to their resumes that they wouldn?t have gotten otherwise. I?m so proud to be part of NSCS for a lifetime!

I noticed that you haven?t joined yet, so I wanted to follow up with you before the April 26 invitation deadline ? I don?t want you to miss out on the opportunity to join.

By joining now you'll be a member just in time to apply for our New Member Award, a $1,000 scholarship awarded to 50 new members just like you! You may also be eligible to apply for some of our other open scholarships, including the Summer Scholar Award and the Jim Duncan Award for Perseverance.

Join NSCS by April 26 to start your lifetime membership!
