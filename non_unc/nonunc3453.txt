Errors in Answer Key for Quiz 8  (11/11/16 4:26 PM)

Question 1
The answer for question 1 was 0x0E, but I answered 0e (I didn't include the=
 hex prefix since the question asked for a hex value)

Could we get points back for the answers 0E and 0e?

Question 3 asks what the following C function will return
int m(float a) {
  while (a > 0) { a--; }
  while (a < 0) { a++; }
  return a;
}
It actually may not return a value at all due to float imprecision (where a=
-- =3D=3D a).

For example, when a is 10000000, the function returns nearly instantly, but=
 when a is 50000000, the function never returns (simply because=C2=A0500000=
00 - 1 is=C2=A050000000 in floating point).

The answer key has the answer as C (return 0 always), but it should be D (m=
ight never return).
Question 8

In floating point arithmetic,
33.0 * 1.0 / 11.0 =3D 3.0
8.0 / 2.0 =3D 4.0
0.02 * 50 =3D 1
are all true. Even though the individual values are not absolutely precise,=
 the results end up being correct. These can be easily verified in C.

As such, the answers A, B, and D are all correct, but the answer key only h=
as B as correct.

I suspect this is why the grades were so low for this quiz -- can we get cr=
edit back for these questions?
