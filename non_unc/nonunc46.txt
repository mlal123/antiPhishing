Dear Newest Tar Heel,

As a Carolina student, your thoughts and opinions are important. The Office of New Student  Carolina Parent Programs seeks your feedback about your Orientation experience and asks that you please take a few minutes to complete a questionnaire. Your responses will help to shape future programs and initiatives for Carolina students.

The survey should take approximately 10 minutes to complete. Your responses are voluntary and confidential. Responses will not be identified by individual and will be compiled and analyzed as a group. By completing the survey, you will be entered into a drawing for an opportunity to win a UNC backpack and accessories.
