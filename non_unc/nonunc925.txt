i made a mess...

So when trying to submit my part A, it wouldn't let me so I deleted all the part b projects from my assignment 4 so I can submit it. I thought I would be able to pull it again but I couldn't so I tried deleting everything so I can just redownload the whole assignment but i copied and pasted my code somewhere else so I can just copy it back. So I redownload the whole assignment and copied my code in but when I tried to run it, it didnt work. So i though, "hey let me just delete it all again and close eclipse as a whole" and while I tried to close eclipse I closed my word doc containing my code and it didnt save, but i did not fret because i know that if i did it once then i could do it again. BUUUUUUUUUUTTTTT, my assignment 4 still wont work and Idk what to do.
