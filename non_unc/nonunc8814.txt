Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:

Winter weather is moving into the area and is expected to reach Chapel Hill around 2 p.m. The University will move into Condition 1 at noon today and will remain in Condition 1 until 10 p.m. Conditions will be re-evaluated this evening and an update regarding campus operations for overnight and Tuesday morning will be communicated to the campus by 8 p.m.

Condition 1 (until 10 p.m.)

Current conditions may not pose severe safety risks or logistical challenges, but an event has significant potential to negatively affect - or already is affecting - local area commuting, important campus services, or the efficient functioning of campus buildings and grounds. Employees, faculty, and students should consider their own personal circumstances to determine whether to report late, leave early, or not report at all.

Adverse Weather Policy and Background 

Unless a change in operational status is announced, the University always operates on a regular schedule. UNC-Chapel Hill may activate three adverse weather operating conditions:  Condition 1 - Reduced Operations (University is open); Condition 2 - Suspended Operations (classes are cancelled; University is open only for mandatory operations); and Condition 3 - Closure (classes are cancelled; offices and facilities are closed).

Faculty and staff are reminded of the University of North Carolina system adverse weather policy for all UNC campuses that took effect in 2016.

Key factors include projections about weather and travel conditions on area roads and campus sidewalks, as well as the operating plans of Chapel Hill Transit and other regional transit. Safety is the number one priority when making weather decisions about campus operations.
