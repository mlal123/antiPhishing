Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Problem Set listed in gradebook already

Can anyone who has submitted the assignment see if they have a 100 under assignments? I submitted once, went back and changed some answers, and do not have a 100. Only reason I am doubting the grading is because There was that one section that we had to manually enter stuff, which I think may mess it up. Thanks
