Python Implementation - Use 3.6

The version of Python we will be grading in is 3.6. Because the SEED Labs V=
M is=C2=A0Ubuntu 12.04, which has reached its end of life, 3.2.3 is the ver=
sion of python available. You are welcome to develop in the VM but I would =
recommend testing on your host machine with 3.6 to verify correctness. Ther=
e=C2=A0will likely be no difference but it is worth mentioning.=C2=A0

This is also a good time to mention that you should not store critical data=
 on your Ubuntu VM, given that it has stopped receiving security updates. I=
f you have any questions about setting up Python3, or the VMs feel free to =
reach out to us.=C2=A0
