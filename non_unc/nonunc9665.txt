Hi Kiricka,



I hope you're having a good day, my name is Mangza Lal, I am currently a ri=
sing senior at UNC-CH studying Computer Science, Business, and Entrepreneur=
ship. One of my goals this summer is to join the fight against Human and Se=
x trafficking, it's a topic that's been on my mind for some time but never =
knew, largely still don't, what to do about it. I read up a lot on the curr=
ent affairs of human and sex trafficking in the U.S as well as in North Car=
olina specifically and I want to help. I was emailing you in hopes of guida=
nce around what more I can do to help fight, what I think is the greatest c=
rime for humanity. I live in Chapel Hill, and I will be here all summer and=
 spending my time working on my projects and I'm hoping to add human traffi=
cking to my list of projects to work on but I'm largely clueless about what=
 I can do. Thank you for your time, hope this email catches you.
