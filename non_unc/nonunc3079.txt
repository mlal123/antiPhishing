Pollev Summary Presentation  (10/16/16 3:15 PM)

Cheers all,

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I don't know whether or not anyone else will=
 find this useful, but I made a powerpoint of all the pollev questions that=
 were available, because it helps me to study it like this instead of click=
ing links. Some of the answers are obvious, some are not, but I'll post an =
answer page (like the blank one at the end of this presentation) once I fin=
ish going over it tonight, if anyone is interested.

Good luck!

Exam Format  ()

Will the exam be formatted similar to the practice exam or will it be somet=
hing different? I'm asking because the practice one has no multiple choice =
and the exam guide says to bring a scantron.Thanks

Previous Exam  (10/16/16 4:29 PM)

Can someone explain 7c on the practice exam and also describe what the O(N)=
 Binary heap build algorithm is?

BST Remove Algorithm  (10/16/16 5:05 PM)

In our powerpoints it says that the remove operation in a BST is accomplish=
ed by preforming a findmin on the right subtree and setting that node to ro=
ot. In the animation the operation is preformed by doing a findmax on the =
=C2=A0left subtree. Both accomplish the same thing, but result in different=
 trees. Does it matter which way we do this on the test?

BHEAP Complexity On Average  (10/16/16 6:34 PM)

I understand why on average, insertion in BHEAP takes O(1), but can anyone =
explain why on average, delMin takes O(log N) in BHEAP?

Confused about Rotation Name  (10/16/16 7:06 PM)

In the Lecture PPT, it shows that


So I guess we name "RR Single Rotation as the rotation in clockwise directi=
on", but in the next powerpoint, it shows that=C2=A0


This rotation is in clockwise direction but the name is LL Single

So....Which one is corrected?

Thanks!
