Build vs Successive Inserts Create Different Heaps

I just wanted to check to see if there may be something wrong with my build=
 implementation.=C2=A0 I noticed that under some circumstances, my build im=
plementation creates a different heap structure as opposed to me doing succ=
essive inserts on the heap.=C2=A0 My build method is not doing successive i=
nserts and is percolating down to construct the heap.=C2=A0 Hence, my quest=
ion is, is this type of behavior fine for this assignment?=C2=A0 After test=
ing my build on various collections, even though the structure may be diffe=
rent than successive builds, it still creates a valid minimum binary heap (=
fulfills order and structure).=C2=A0 I've been using the online data struct=
ure simulations as a reference.

Example Build with 5,3,1,0:

Online Simulation creates a build of [sentinel, 0,1,3,5]
My Implementation creates a build of [sentinel, 0,3,1,5]

(P.S. The online simulation and the book have different build structures fo=
r the minbinheap on p.257, Figure 6.18)
