Type I vs. Type II -- Canzani's class  (4/20/17 9:30 PM)

In one of the third midterms, the first question asks you to draw an example of a region that is type I, but not type II. We didn't really focus on this in our class; should we review/memorize type I vs. type II for the exam or will that not be explicitly asked because not all sections did it?
