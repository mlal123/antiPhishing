PM Session Monday

Hi guys!

I'm holding a PM session tomorrow (Monday 1/30) in Genome Cafe right after class until 1:30. We can talk about any questions you may have about study strategies for the upcoming test, course material, or general test review! I'll have a table and a little sign with my name and BIOL 101 on it so you can recognize me.
