Midterm Solution Question 5

Why is it true that "divide and conquer approach with an $$\Theta(n)$$ combination cost always yields a $$\Theta(n \text{lg} n)$$ alg'm"? Is not Quicksort a divide and conquer approach with $$\Theta(n)$$ combination cost that has worst case runtime of $$\Theta(n^2)$$?
