Two strings, one bit difference?

I am confused about how we can create a string of at least 10 readable asci=
i characters that differ by only one bit, and this change in one bit must c=
hange more than one character.=C2=A0 Does this mean that the change has to =
involve more than a change from "a" to "b" or that it must be more than jus=
t a one character difference between the two strings?=C2=A0 If the latter i=
s true, I don't really understand how this is possible at this point since =
as far as I can tell all ascii characters are uniquely identified by some b=
it string.=C2=A0 Any thoughts/advice on this would be appreciated! Thanks i=
n advance.
