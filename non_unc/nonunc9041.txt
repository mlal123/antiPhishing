What does data look like in the future?

  



Does it still live in the cloud? Will it be secure from new waves of cyb=
er threats? Will it offer new, unexplored insights?

  



What if we said=E2=80=A6 the future of data is Blockchain.And tha=
t future is here today. 



Many data scientists already work with this truly 21st ce=
ntury technology.



They=E2=80=99ve learned how to master Blockchain, understand its secrets=
 and use it to their own advantage (and their career=E2=80=99s advantage).

  



And we want you to master this technology too.

  



That=E2=80=99s why, after months of blood, sweat and tears, Hadelin and =

This was one of the most challenging courses we=E2=80=99ve put together.=
 Ever.

  



Blockchain is an easily misunderstood technology. Most people think it=
=E2=80=99s Bitcoin, while others don=E2=80=99t understand its distributed n=
ature.=20

  



We wanted to create a course that not only showed you how to use Blockch=
ain, but how to intuitively understand the concepts behind it.

  



In short: we challenged ourselves=E2=80=A6

  



To Create A Course =
That Would Change Careers and Even the World!

  



To fully master Blockchain, you=E2=80=99ll need it all: deep theory, ste=
p-by-step instruction and plenty of practical exercises.

  



And that=E2=80=99s exactly what you=E2=80=99ll get!

  



On top of all the theory you=E2=80=99ll ever need, in this course you wi=
ll learn how to code your very own Blockchains in Python from the ground up=
.

  



In short, Blockchain A-Z will help you not only understand this revoluti=
