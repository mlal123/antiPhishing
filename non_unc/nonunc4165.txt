Dear Mangza Lal,

Thank you very much for your participation in the Resident Advisor 2017F-2018S process so far. We were very impressed with your application and individual interview and at this time would like to invite you to join us for Group Process this **Friday,January 27 and January 28.** Please remember that your attendance at both Spotlight Night (**on Friday January 27th**) and Group Process Activities (**on Saturday January 28th**) are required steps in your candidacy. Should you be unable to join please contact me at allave@email.unc.edu to discuss further how this will affect your candidacy. If you are currently an abroad candidate, we already have this status noted, but feel free to reach out if you have questions.

_**On tomorrow you will have one of our current RAs reach out to you to share some more details. They will be your "host" throughout Friday and Saturday for Spotlight Night and Group Process. You will be placed in a group of about 8-10 other candidates and have one current RA help guide you through the process. The RA will have more information to share, but here are some quick things to know about this Friday and Saturday.**_

**Spotlight Night**: This event will occur from either **5:00pm-6:15pm** or **6:20-7:45pm** depending on your group. Your host will email you to determine a time and location to meet with your group before the event begins. You will meet your other group members and have a chance to get to know each other briefly. From there, you will go to the Union on the second floor lounge to walk through and meet with a few staff members from each of our 16 communities. You will hear a bit more about what it is like working in each community and have a chance to ask any questions you have to current staff in those locations. If you are selected for the role, you may end up placed in a community you are not as familiar with, so this is a great time to learn about them all.

Group Activities: This event will occur either from **8:45am-10:45am** or **11:00am- 12:45pm**. Your host will email you to determine a time and location to meet with your group before the event begins. You will participate in 3 different activities as a group. This will help us to see how you work in a team, your problem solving skills, and ability to think critically.

**You can now fill out the preference ranking form on eRezlife, but we recommend you complete it after Spotlight Night on Friday, January 22****nd****.** You will simply log in to your application to complete this form anytime between now and January 25th; you can also edit/update the form until this date. This form asks you to note preferences for year round communities, community styles, population types, and interest in our Residential Learning Programs. You will learn about all of these options at Spotlight Night.

**\*Candidates should be prepared for either time on both days. If you have a serious conflict, email LaVel Heintz at allave@email.unc.edu before 8am on Monday morning and we will try to accommodate you as best we can.**

**Attire for both days is casual**. Please do not feel the need to wear formal business attire as you will be moving around and we want you to be comfortable (and warm!)

Best,
