FSM for Stopwatch  (10/02/16 12:57 PM)

Hey guys, I wanted to share something that gave me some pain in making the =
stopwatch FSM. =C2=A0Remember to describe=C2=A0the loop-back edges in PAUSI=
NG_UP, RESUMING_UP, PAUSING_DOWN, RESUMING_DOWN. =C2=A0I originally elided =
them for simplicity, but it creates some weird bugs such as not pausing whe=
n the button is pressed too long/too short, flipping between pausing and co=
unting etc. =C2=A0So if you're having problems with functionality and not s=
ure why, make sure you have all the edges described in the state transition=
 diagram.
