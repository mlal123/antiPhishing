Chromosome definition  (2/15/17 1:01 PM)

I'm confused about the definition of a chromosome. In class today, Dr. Evans said that a chromosome was a double stranded DNA molecule. However, the book says that a eukaryotic chromosome "consists of one long DNA molecule-bearing hundreds or thousands of genes- and a number of protein molecules, which are attached to the DNA" and in prokaryotes, "genes are carried on a single circular DNA molecule that, with associated proteins, constitutes the organism's chromosome."
Essentially, are proteins considered part of a chromosome or not?
