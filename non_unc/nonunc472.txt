Arrays Program suspends and won't end itself  (10/01/15 10:33 AM)

So in class today we did this code:

public class arrays {public static void main(String[] args){  int[] myArray=
 =3D new int[3];  myArray[0] =3D 12; myArray[1] =3D 25; myArray[2] =3D 50; =
int j =3D 0;  for (int i =3D 0; 1 < myArray.length; i++){  j =3D i*10; Syst=
em.out.println(myArray[i] + " " + j);}}}Whenever I run this code, a window =
pops up that says "confirm perspective swtich" where it basically says this=
 kind of launch is configured to open when it suspends."Why is my program s=
uspending and not terminating?

Game Over Phrase Placement (Assignment 2)  (10/01/15 10:51 AM)

In Assignment 2, the directions say to print "Game Over" after the last att=
empt at the story has been completed. Does this mean we should put the "Gam=
e Over" phrase outside of the loop=C2=A0that causes the game to repeat? My =
output looks like the sample output, but I want to be sure that I have it i=
n the right place.

Assignment 2 Question  (10/01/15 11:06 AM)

Hi there,

At the beginning of the program, I'm finding that I have to input twice bef=
ore the first path is taken (Story A to B, E, or H).

If that isn't descriptive enough, essentially I've declared the scanner key=
board, and set up nested if-else statements for the path. The paths work wi=
th the correct input, however, the program the first integer. Are there any=
 thoughts as to why this is happening? I'm just trying to make the very fir=
st input on the keyboard begin the story.
