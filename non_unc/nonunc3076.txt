Sorting and Building of BHEAP (or PRQUE)  (10/16/16 12:40 PM)

I'm confused with the difference in 'sorting' and 'building' a BHEAP.
From what I understand, building is constructing a BHEAP=C2=A0with structur=
al and heap-order.
Sorting is retrieving the sequence=C2=A0of nodes from lowest priority to hi=
ghest.

If so, how does the sorting of BHEAP in the slide end up as O(N) + O(N log =
N)?
1. Insert all values=C2=A0just considering just the Structural property. O(=
N)
2.=C2=A0Start with parent of last node, and do a bubble down sequentially. =
O(N=C2=A0log N)
THIS PART FINISHES BUILDING.=C2=A0WHERE IS THE RETRIEVING PART?

So for example, if we assume to build a BHEAP with elements [5,4,3,2,1]
The heap in 1. will be
5-4-3-2-1
After bubbling down it will be
1-2-3-5-4

But shouldn't the sorting also involve sequence of delMin operations to ach=
ieve
1-2-3-4-5?


------------------------------------Followup question----------------------=
--------------
If we are understanding 'sorting' as just maintaining=C2=A0structural and h=
eap-order of a BHEAP,
then wouldn't the sorting method of inserting elements one-by-one finish=C2=
=A0at
N log N? Not 2(N log N) where we do a=C2=A0delMin N times after building th=
e BHEAP?
