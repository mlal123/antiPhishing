Remove & Keeping track of a parent node  (9/19/16 7:17 PM)

I've worked out remove so that I need to refer to a parent node in order to=
 create a link to the node that will replace that node (if that makes sense=
) and now I'm trying to write a method in BST_Node that will find the paren=
t and I'm struggling a bit. If you've done it this way, can you point me in=
 the right direction without too much helping?=C2=A0If this is a terrible w=
ay to approach remove, what's a better way?

return type of insert()  (9/19/16 9:12 PM)

Hey all,

So I'm struggling with writing code which supports=C2=A0the required return=
 type for insert( ).

The textbook gives example code where insert( ) takes the String and the no=
de as parameters, then returns the root of the new subtree after insertion.

One of the TAs recommended that I use this as a helper method and call it i=
n my actual insert( ) method.

However, since we are intended to write an insert method which returns a bo=
olean, I am encountering repeated difficulty finding a way to call on the b=
ook's insert method. How did you work around this?

Thank you!!
