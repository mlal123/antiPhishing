Unable to copy ex1.asm into lab5 directory from desktop

I have tried what I have found online for the scp command and keep getting the error:

The authenticity of host 'classroom1.cs.unc.edu (152.2.130.35)' can't be established.ECDSA key fingerprint is 29:e9:ff:b8:3b:79:0d:dd:36:e1:74:e3:6f:d6:23:72.Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yesWarning: Permanently added 'classroom1.cs.unc.edu,152.2.130.35' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.The Department of Computer Science at UNC Chapel Hill.This system is intended for use by department affiliates only.Unauthorized access to this system is prohibited.

My input was:
scp -r ~/Desktop/ex1.asm.txt myusername@classroom1.cs.unc.edu:~/comp411lab/lab5

This was just one trial. Each time I tried different things, I got the same response. Am I going about this entirely wrong?
