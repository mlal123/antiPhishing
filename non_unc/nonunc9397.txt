         Your Personal Early Bird Invitation to Get Lifetime=
 Access to the 5hr + Intro to Data Science A-Z=E2=84=A2 Course!

  

Data Science can seem a complex, technical topic. And some of the algori=
thms and techniques can get very advanced.

  



But=E2=80=A6 for the most part, it=E2=80=99s not something complex or my=
sterious.

  



If you follow a well-structured process, almost ANYONE can equip th=
emselves with the skills to become a Data Scientist.

  



Hadel=
in and I sat down and mapped out that process

  



There=E2=80=99s a high demand for Data Scientists =E2=80=93 those who kn=
ow what to do are a hot commodity right now.

  



And with this course and some hard work, companies could soon be approac=
hing you.

  



That=E2=80=99s why we created this: to give you everything you need to b=
ecome a Data Scientist, even if you have no experience.

  



So, after weeks of blood, sweat and tears, Hadelin and I proudly present=
:

  



I=
ntro to Data Science A-Z=E2=84=A2 - Your Step-By-Step Guide To Starting

  



It was a particularly HUGE =
challenge to create this course.



We wanted a course that would not only pull everything a Data Scientist =
needs to know together, but organize it in a logical way that would enhance=
 your learning, reinforce your new skills and prepare you for real-world Da=
ta Science.

  



In short: We challenged ourselves=E2=80=A6

  



To =
Create A Course That Would Kickstart Your Entire Career.

  



We wanted a course specifically for beginners =E2=80=93 theory, walk-thr=
oughs and practical exercises that would make Data Science second nature to=
 you much faster.

  



You heard that right!

  



There are dozens of useful tips & tricks scattered throughout the co=
urse, but more importantly, you=E2=80=99ll be following a structured, compr=
ehensive program that leaves no stone unturned.

  



Plus, this is a c=
ourse that will grow.

  



It=E2=80=99s almost impossible to summarize and structure such a broad s=
ubject like data science, but this is a problem facing so many newcomers to=
 the field that we were ready to tackle the challenge.

  



Since topics change, from analytics to software applications =E2=80=93 t=
his course will also evolve, and we will continue adding new materials as n=
ew lessons and useful insights come along.

  



But we st=
ill need your support to keep on going.

  



Both aspiring and new Data Scientists, along with many other modern prof=
essionals truly need a course like this. It=E2=80=99s is our responsibility=
 to get this content out for people like YOU.

  



And that's why we're sending you this special Early Bird Invitation to j=
ump on board with this MEGA-EPIC Intro to Data Science Course.

  



Does That Sound=
 Exciting?

  



Well, guess what...

  



There's more!

  



I value my existing students and that's why I've prepared something excl=

As a Data Scientist, you WILL write your own programs. And there=E2=80=
=99s nothing more frustrating than losing files or deleting a huge chunk of=
 code accidentally. A source control program like Github ensures this won=
=E2=80=99t happen to you.

  



Github also gives you an opportunity to display and share your work publ=
icly (and safely). But knowing where to start here can be intimidating. We=
