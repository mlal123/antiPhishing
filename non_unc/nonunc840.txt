Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
4.3 width and height getters  (11/13/15 2:59 PM)

So the instructions say that I don't need width and height instance variabl=
es for the getters, but that I "can get that information directly from the=
=C2=A0pixel=C2=A0array's length properties." Even after reading that and th=
e hint, I don't know how to go about it. How do I get the width and length =
from the pixels array?
