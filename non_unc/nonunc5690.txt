A note from University Career Services at UNC-Chapel Hill

Hi Mangza,As you may have read in one of our earlier messages, the system k=
nown as Careerolina has officially been retired. =C2=A0With this message I =
am excited to announce the new system from University Career Services, call=
ed Handshake, is now up and running. =C2=A0We think you'll find this system=
 to be a great improvement and bring a larger number and type of employers =
and opportunities to Carolina students.A few important notes:1. You can acc=
ess the system by going to careers.unc.edu and clicking the "Handshake" ico=
ns on the front page (it may still say "Careerolina" if it's cached in your=
 browser) and logging in with your ONYEN.2. You already have an account in =
the system. =C2=A0So, you do not need to request one. =C2=A0When you log in=
, you'll find your account is pre-populated with your major, GPA, class sta=
nding, and the email address you have listed as "preferred" with the univer=
sity. =C2=A0Of course, you completely control the privacy of this informati=
on, along with any other profile/documents you include. 3. If any of the sy=
nced information is different from what you expect, you'll need to work wit=
h academic advising, the registrar, or Connect Carolina (depending on the i=
ssue). =C2=A0We are unable to change any of the information that is synced =
in on your behalf, since it will always reflect what the university knows a=
bout you.



4. Complete your profile when you first log in. Start by uploading and resu=
me and then fill it out in the same way that you might complete a LinkedIn =
profile. =C2=A0You can make this profile searchable by employers that we ha=
ve approved to recruit at UNC! =C2=A0You can make parts of your profile pub=
lic and hide other parts, if you so desire (i.e. can hide GPA).=20

5. If you had any documents in Careerolina, they did not transfer over auto=
matically, and you'll need to upload new versions. =C2=A0Note, the new syst=
em does not require a review of your documents. =C2=A0So, we recommend you =
come see us or work with us via Skype, telephone, or email to have your doc=
uments reviewed before you upload them.6. =C2=A0Handshake is also now the p=
lace to schedule appointments with UCS staff. =C2=A0You can either click th=
e appointments link on our website or the appointments menu option within H=
andshake.We look forward to helping you make the most of this new system an=
d will be offering ways for you to learn more in the weeks, months, and sem=
esters ahead. =C2=A0For now, log in and begin to explore all it has to offe=
