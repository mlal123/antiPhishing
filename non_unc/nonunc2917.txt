Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

2.22 in book  (10/03/16 9:36 PM)

This question wants us to convert this statement in C:A=3DC[0] <<4 to MIPS,=
 assuming $t1=3DA, $t2=3DB, and $s1 is the base address of C.

This is what I have.add $t4, $0, $s1
sll =C2=A0 =C2=A0$t4, $t4, 4
sw =C2=A0 $t1, 0[$t4]

The first line is what I really don't understand, because I still don't ful=
ly get how to refer to an array in C. I want to add the value of C[0] into =
$t4, and then shift left, and then store that in $t1. But how do I refer to=
 the base address of C? Can I just use $s1? Or is there a different way tha=
t I am not understanding? Thank you.

Error when submitting lab5  ()

The grading script gives me an error when I submit, saying a file from the =
server was not found. There was another post about this earlier. Is the sub=
mit script fully functional or we cannot submit yet?
