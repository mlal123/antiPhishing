MASTER THEOREM IN THE SLIDES WHICH THE CLASS WAS TAUGHT HAS BEEN INCORRECT =
FOR THE ENTIRE SEMESTER

It turns out that the Master Theorem which we were taught to use for recurr=
ence relations is incorrect, and I believe that this just might have an eff=
ect on the exam (/s). The correct Master Theorem is here:=C2=A0https://www.=
wikiwand.com/en/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms). This is different =
from the one which is listed in the slides:=C2=A0https://sakai.unc.edu/acce=
ss/content/group/2ba5ac9f-8aa8-4c5a-833d-c1ce15564080/pdfs%20of%20video%20l=
