Greetings Summoners,

We regret to inform you that we were forced to move Friendship Friday due
to a last minute room reservation override. We sincerely apologize for any
confusion that this may have caused, but don't worry, we've got a new date
and time that's guaranteed for us!

*Friendship Friday has been changed to next Friday, September 22, from 8-10
PM in Fred Brooks 007.* We plan on all activities to stay the same, and we
hope to see you there!

Oh, and here's a little secret for everyone... we've got a *really big*
*event* in the works, so keep an eye out for any emails and updates!

Sincerely,

League Board
