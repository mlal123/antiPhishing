Here's what has happened in MATH 233 on Piazza:

dA for Surface Integrals  (5/04/17 1:09 PM)

When evaluating a surface integral for a disk in some plane (e.g. the top p=
art=C2=A0of a cylinder), if the parameterization used is r(u, v) where u is=
 the angle and v is the changing radius, would you integrate for v dv du? W=
hat is the surface is the tube part of the cylinder and the parameterizatio=
n is r(u, v) where u is the angle and v is the length of the tube? Would yo=
u just integrate for du dv? Does the =C2=A0v dv du integration only apply t=
o surfaces with changing radius?
