Happy Thursday, Chapel Hill! The second day of classes proved much less e=
ventful than the first, but stuff still went down. Here's what's happenin=
g around town:

**QUICK HITS**

- UNC field hockey is ranked No. 1 in the preseason after last season's n=
ational championship loss. But even their head coach thinks the ranking i=
s a=C2=A0bit too generous. ( http://sable.madmimi.com/c/14086?id=3D109067=

 someday and place a lock there with her partner.=C2=A0

**THE STORY ON=C2=A0SAM**

While there hasn't been a large-scale protest around the Confederate monu=
ment in the past day, the gates around Silent Sam have remained up and se=
veral groups have reacted to its continued presence.=C2=A0

- "I could put my dog up there. I=E2=80=99ll put my dog up there and make=

pel Hill politics, the answer is probably not. But the organization that =
endorsed three successful bids for election in 2015 is worth taking a loo=
k at as we approach this year's campaigns.
