=E2=80=9CAll of these bodies are trying to get their standards adopted acr=

How publishers like the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Politico are mone=
tizing local politics =E2=86=92 (https://digiday.com/media/news-publishers=

=E2=80=9CUnlike a subscription product focused on consumer-focused topics=
 like sports that can be targeted at people using Facebook=2C site persona=
lization or a newspaper=E2=80=99s existing subscriber base=2C most paid po=

=3D.70510e8371ff)
=E2=80=9CHere=E2=80=99s what we found. Compared with other stations in the=
 same market=2C once Sinclair buys a station=2C that station: 1. Increases=
 its coverage of national politics by roughly 25 percent=2C 2. Decreases i=
ts coverage of local politics by roughly 10 percent=2C 3. Shifts significa=
ntly rightward in its coverage=E2=80=99s ideological slant=2C and 4. Loses=
 a very small share of its viewers.=E2=80=9D
BuzzFeed / Megha Rajagopalan
Facebook has been accused of helping the Vietnamese government crack down=
 on dissent =E2=86=92 (https://www.buzzfeed.com/meghara/facebook-vietnam-m=

arted a media war =E2=86=92 (https://deadspin.com/how-i-made-a-dumb-video-=
making-fun-of-sinclair-broadcas-1825106452)
=E2=80=9CWhat kind of impact all this has made is hard to say. It=E2=80=99=
s impossible to pin down exactly how many views the video has=2C as it was=
 almost immediately ripped and posted to Reddit without any context minute=
s after we published it=2C not to mention that thousands of people posted=
 it to Facebook=2C but the number is at least 30 million from my counting.=
 I=E2=80=99ll reckon with whatever harm might result from all this=2C but=
 it seems pretty clear this is just the beginning.=E2=80=9D
