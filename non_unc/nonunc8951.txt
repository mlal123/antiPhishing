Got it - thanks Jen=E2=80=A6 really appreciate it!

Mangza, it would be great if you can ask everyone to do some reading on =
the Facebook scandal involving Cambridge Analytica and how they=E2=80=99ve=
 handled it over the past week. Make some notes and be prepared to =
critique where you think they did a good job and where they fumbled.

We=E2=80=99re going to be talking about about the dimensions of =
corporate reputation - including handling mistakes (crisis =
communications) and dealing with ethical issues in business. It affects =
companies of any size - even startups.

My number is 650-521-4436 if there are any questions.

Thanks and I look forward to seeing everyone tomorrow!
