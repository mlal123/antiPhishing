Your classmate posted a new Question. 

What does it mean for a method to be undefined for its class type?

I keep getting the error,

"the method BorderEffect() is undefined for the type BorderEffect"

when I try to call that method in that class.
Also, if I try to call the same method with a color object in the beginning, it gives a similar error. What is the relationship that must be between a method and the objects/methods that you call it with for them to work together correctly?

Thanks
