Extra Credit: Fake echo replies being captured on lo interface  (12/06/17 1=
1:06 PM)

For the extra credit part of the assignment, I've gotten to the point where=
 I can send a ping from VM:A to a non-existent IP address, and then my pyth=
on program on VM:B picks up these echo request packets up and generates an =
echo reply. However, the echo replies generated by my program are only pick=
ed up when capturing on the lo interface on wireshark=C2=A0which to my know=
ledge only picks up traffic that is being sent to the=C2=A0localhost

I suspect this could be because the destination for the echo reply is the I=
P address of VM:A=C2=A0which is running on the same host machine as VM:B an=
d therefore they could have the same IP address. But I was wondering if any=
one with more knowledge on all this could point me in the right direction.
