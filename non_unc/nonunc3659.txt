Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

Assignment 5  (11/29/16 3:54 PM)

For assignment 5, the review on my assignment says I failed DelNode Test 3. When I checked the TestDump I couldn't find DelNode Test 3 but I saw DelNode Test case 2 which is the third DelNode test so I am assuming that is the test I failed. However, when I put the test into my playground it returns the values I am suppose to get. So what should I do to have someone look back at it for a regrade?
