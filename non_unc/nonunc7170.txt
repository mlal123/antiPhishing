My name is Staff Sergeant Tobias and I am the officer recruiter with the U.=
S. Marine Corps stationed here in Raleigh, NC.=20

I run an ROTC-ALTERNATIVE program called Platoon Leaders Class (PLC) for fr=
eshmen through juniors and Officer Candidate Course (OCC) for seniors and g=
raduates. This program provides top-notch leadership training and the oppor=
tunity to accept a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Marine Corps. W=
ith your education, you may qualify for one of these programs, which allows=
 you to continue your studies while earning your commission as a Marine Off=
icer. This is a little-known elite program that is designed to develop and =
evaluate your abilities to lead large groups of your peers, while evaluatin=
g your physical fitness and academic abilities. If you are interested in a =
