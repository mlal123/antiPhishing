Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Lab1  (9/07/15 3:50 PM)

I am a little unsure about the first few instructions for Lab1. It said to =
add, multiply divide and find remainder in the first few lines of instructi=
on. So would the display output of Lab1 be the results of those calculation=
s and then the other 5 lines? Something like this?

0
00
000
0000
The two integers are:=C2=A0num1=C2=A0and=C2=A0num2
Their addition is:=C2=A0sum
Their product is:=C2=A0product
The quotient is:=C2=A0quotient
The remainder is:=C2=A0remainder
