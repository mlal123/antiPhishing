Good Morning!

If we have not been introduced yet, my name is Megan Henry and I am the tec=
hnology recruiter for Capital One at UNC. I wanted to reach out and introdu=
ce myself and personally thank you for stopping by our table in the CS buil=
ding on Wednesday. As the lead tech recruiter for UNC, my goal is to show s=
tudents that Capital One is More Than Just a Bank. I hope that you were able to get some o=
f your questions answered but please do not hesitate to reach out to me mov=
ing forward!

I wanted to share with you an opportunity we have at Capital One for freshm=
en and sophomores. In May and August, we will host ~40 top freshmen and sop=
homores for a one-week program called the Software Engineering Summit at our Labs in Clarendon, VA (rig=
ht outside of DC). During this week, the students will explore and develop =
the software and technology skills valued by today's top employers. Student=
s will take part in technical and soft-skill training sessions, including a=
 rigorous hackathon and presentation to Capital One leadership. Plus, you w=
ill have the opportunity to meet recent college grads now employed at Capit=
al One and network with other students from top colleges and universities. =
Capital One handles all participant travel and accommodations; your job is =
to learn new skills, challenge yourself, and code side-by-side with our tec=
hnology subject matter experts.

Directions to apply are included in the attached flyer with additional deta=
ils!
