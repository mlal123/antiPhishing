     I am writing to let you know that the resume critique you requested from TopResume while visiting Glassdoor is on its way.
       
The critique is designed to give you an advantage in today's competitive job market. The goal is to give you insights into how hiring managers view your resume.

Within the next few days, you will receive an email from me including the critique of your resume and some recommendations. You can monitor my progress here:
