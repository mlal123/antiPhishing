Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

An 8 bit breadboard computer computing Fibonacci numbers  (12/11/16 1:02 PM)

I saw this today and thought other people might be interested.

This guy built a simple 8 bit computer on a breadboard, compiled a C program to his assembly language, and then manually puts the program into memory.

He's got the clock, bus, memory, registers, program counter, etc. connected to LEDs and digital displays, so it's neat to see it all working together given the context from our course.

You can skip to ~6:40 if you just want to see the program running (to skip the code compiling and assembly explanation).

ps4 flip flop  (12/11/16 3:32 PM)

How is my flip frlop here incorrect? apparently the very end is wrong (the instructor said it was incorecct at the 8th dash line). But after going back through it I can't find anything wrong.
