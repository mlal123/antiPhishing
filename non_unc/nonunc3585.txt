Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
A5 topo sort case 7  (11/22/16 2:41 AM)

it says that it can only be sorted in one specific order, but the final edge shouldn't be able to be add because the id is negative. Wouldn't that mean that A D B C would be correct?
