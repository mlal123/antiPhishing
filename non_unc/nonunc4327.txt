Dear Students, Faculty and Staff: 
 
Earlier this morning, the Orange Water and Sewer Authority (OWASA) announced that local residents may return to normal water use, effective immediately. OWASA has resumed full operations and no longer needs residents to limit water use. The announcement is posted here.

UNC-Chapel Hill will reopen for regular operations at 10 a.m. today. 
 
University facilities will begin reopening on their normal schedules as employees are able to resume their work schedules. 
 
Classes will be held, and offices will be open on a normal schedule on Monday.

The University thanks all students, faculty and staff for doing their part to help OWASA and the local community address OWASA's water emergency and successful recovery.
