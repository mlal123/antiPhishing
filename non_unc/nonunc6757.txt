across the finish line for the kids! There will be pre and post-race
activities, including doctors from the hospital and our kid co-captains
will visit! Participants get free food and a free t-shirt. If you are
unable to register tonight, we will also have same-day registration at the
race.

All proceeds will benefit the patients and families of UNC Children's
Hospital through CFTK. CFTK helps to cover things that insurance doesn't:
meal tickets, utility bills, gas cards, diapers... all things that families
shouldn't have to worry about when their child is in the hospital! CFTK
also provides innovative programming and grants in the hospital to help
improve hospital care.
