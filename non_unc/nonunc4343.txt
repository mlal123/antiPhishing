#17 in 14.2

The problem is:
limit of (x, y) as (x, y) approaches (0,0) of:
$$(x^2+y^2)/(sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + 1) - 1)$$

The answer in the book is 2, but I would think that the limit would not exist, as the numerator would go to 0 + 0 and the denominator would go to 1 - 1 = 0, so you would get the indeterminate form of 0/0. How do you get 2 as the limit?

Thanks!
