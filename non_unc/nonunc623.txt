Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:

The University will TEST the emergency sirens and text messages on Wednesda=
y, October 28, at 6:30 p.m.=20

While we test the sirens each semester to make sure the equipment works pro=
perly=E2=80=94and the first test was a success=E2=80=94this second test is =
required because new equipment installed at DPS Emergency Communication Cen=
ter and ITS Control Center need to be tested. The only way to test this upd=
ate is to have an alarm activation. The new hardware will alert individuals=
 in each location when the sirens are activated. Carolina also has never co=
nducted an evening siren test. It is prudent to have an evening test to ens=
ure overall readiness on campus.=C2=A0=20

During the test, anyone outside on or near campus likely will hear the sire=
ns. (The sirens are not designed to be heard inside or while you are in a v=
ehicle.) The sirens will sound an alert tone along with a brief pre-recorde=
d voice message. When testing is complete, a different siren tone and voice=
 message will signal =E2=80=9CAll clear. Resume regular activities.=E2=80=
=9D=20

The sirens sound only for a major emergency or an immediate safety or healt=
h threat such as:

=E2=80=A2	An armed and dangerous person on or near campus;
=E2=80=A2	A major chemical spill or hazard;
=E2=80=A2	A tornado warning for the Chapel Hill-Carrboro area issued by the=
 National Weather  Service; or
=E2=80=A2	A different emergency, as determined by the Department of Public =
Safety.

The University also sends a text message to cell phone users who registered=
 their numbers in the online campus directory. In an emergency, the Univers=
ity will post safety-related announcements on the Alert Carolina website, a=
lertcarolina.unc.edu, along with updates. A mobile-friendly version of the =
Alert Carolina website can be found at http://m.alertcarolina.unc.edu/=20

No action is required during the siren test. We do encourage you to review =
the poster, =E2=80=9CWhat You Should Do For An Emergency Warning,=E2=80=9D =
posted in University classrooms, offices, hallways, residence halls and lab=
oratory spaces. It is also accessible online: http://www.alert.unc.edu/exte=
rnal/content/document/1395/1255639/1/AlertClassroomPoster.pdf. The poster o=
utlines what faculty, staff and students should do when the sirens sound fo=
r a significant emergency or immediate threat to health and safety.=20

The sirens are part of the University=E2=80=99s Emergency Notification Syst=
em and an integral element of the University=E2=80=99s communications strat=
egy that uses multiple channels to reach students, faculty and staff, as we=
ll as visitors, local residents, parents and the public. To support that sy=
stem, we follow the Emergency Notification Protocols in informing the campu=
s community using four types of notifications =E2=80=93 Emergency Warning (=
sirens), Timely Warning, Informational Messages and Adverse Weather Message=
s.=20

In a real emergency, we strongly encourage students and employees to use th=
e American Red Cross Safe and Well List to let their parents and families k=
now they are okay in the while keeping cell phone lines open for emergency =
calls. The Safe and Well list is especially helpful in communicating with f=
amily members who are outside the emergency area.
