Here's what has happened in COMP 401-001 on Piazza:

Lecture 6: Encapsulation  (1/27/16 1:35 PM)

We'll finish up our motivating example for object-oriented programming from=
 Tuesday and then start with the principle of encapsulation and what it mea=
ns for how we write OO code.

Slides and example code in the normal places.

A2 Novice  (1/27/16 2:14 PM)

So is the program predetermined to be 25 rows of 7 columns? Or should we co=
de a program that would make the array size vary based on the input of the =
user???

A1 Novice Test failures  (1/27/16 2:45 PM)

Hi, all of my code passed in the auto grader except A1 Novice Test 2. It ap=
pears I have some sort of rounding error. I made a test case in my novice p=
rogram using the one student's info=C2=A0below that failed and found their =
grade to be: =C2=A02.8499999999999996. The expected grade is supposed to be=
 2.85, and thus my program maps this to a different letter grade. I have no=
 idea how to fix this however, as my formula for grade calculation involves=
 only doubles?
Here is my formula for calculating grades:
double weightedAverage =3D (((4.0*assignmentGrade) + recitationGrade + (1.5=
*midterm1) +=C2=A0
     (1.5*midterm2) + (2.0*finalExam))/10.0);

I apologize if this issue has been addressed previously in piazza... if so,=
 I have not seen it. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

A2 Novice - How do I set the dimensions of a second array without input?  (=
1/27/16 2:59 PM)

So I know that I have to get input from the user in order to set the dimens=
ions for the width*height array. I decided to set up a character array afte=
r that, but I'm not sure how to set the dimensions to be equal to the dimen=
sions of the width*height array. Since I can't prompt the user for the same=
 dimensions, is there a way to copy the Scanner's inputs into the second ar=
ray?

Adept Grades slightly off  (1/27/16 3:29 PM)

Hey all,
Java newbie here, I finally figured out how to correctly submit to Auto Gra=
de and have discovered that my grade calculations for Adept are slightly of=
f. It rounds some of the grades up one step: What should be a D+ to a C, wh=
at should be an F to a D, etc.

What I tried doing is converting the recitation score and assignment grades=
 to percentages,=C2=A0then converting them to a 4.0 scale using the followi=
ng formula, then mapping that value to a letter grade using the Weighted Av=
erage table from Novice.=C2=A0

For example, here is how I tried converting the recitation score to a 4.0 s=
cale:

double recitAvg =3D (((s.nextDouble( )/15.0)*100.0)/20.0)-1.0;


Corresponding error message:

Output:
A. Student A
B. Student B+
C. Student C+
D. Student C
E. Student D


Output did not match expectations.
Expected output:

C. Student B-
D. Student D+

compiling issue with autograder  (1/27/16 3:33 PM)

Hi,=C2=A0After I submitted=C2=A0my JAR file, the autograder gave me this:

Looking for package: a1novice
Found a1novice directory, compiling...
...failed!
There was a problem in compiling the code in the package a1novice.
One possible cause is that you did not include the .java source files in yo=
ur JAR file.
Another possibility is that your code contains syntax errors.
The grading script will still attempt to run but may not work.
Plese resubmit when fixed.
Here is the output from the compiler:
javac: file not found: *.java
Usage: javac  
use -help for a list of possible options

It then went on to run the code anyway. I failed all my test cases, but it=
=C2=A0appears as though all my outputs are right when I run the test cases =
on my computer. I've checked very carefully.
Is there any chance this initial error message has anything to do with my p=
rogram failing the tests?
If not, can anyone help me troubleshoot=C2=A0outside of my code?
