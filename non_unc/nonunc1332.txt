Recitation Classroom?  (1/29/16 10:33 AM)

On my connectcarolina it says that recitations are from 10:10 ~ 11:00 at SN0011 and it was COMP110's recitations. I checked Hamilton as well but there was another class there.

Is there another time I can go to recitation and which classroom would it be in?
