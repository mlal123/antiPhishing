Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

Off-by-one Error  (11/30/15 11:11 PM)

Can I get a hint as to how to fix the off-by-one error in the MirrorEffect?=
=C2=A0
I tried setting the=C2=A0=C2=A0x >=3D[expression provided on assignment pag=
e] but it seemed to exacerbate the problem compared to=C2=A0setting: x>[exp=
ression]. I see the fault in my current logic but why doesn't it show an im=
provement in the demo?

Furthermore, when I try to submit the assignment with x>=3D [expression], a=
n error message reading:=C2=A0

"There was an error. Java reports: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetExcept=
ion","pointsPossible":0.0,"points":0.0,"=C2=A0
Therefore, I can't check whether the problem is with my computer.
