**Good Morning y'all, and Happy Tuesday**

Last summer, I found myself in a car with my boyfriend's parents taking w=
hat I refer to as: The Religious Tour. Our first stop was a perfectly-rec=
onstructed Hindu temple in the middle of Lilburn, Ga. Many of you have pr=
obably never heard of Lilburn. Neither had I, but out of a bunch of rolli=
ng hills rose a beautiful Hindu temple brought over from India and recons=
tructed piece by piece. While the sight of this awe-inspiring monolith in=
 the middle of rural Georgia was confusing enough, our second stop was ju=
st as unexpected.

Georgia is home to a Catholic monastery. It houses Catholic monks and nun=
s as they worship and cultivate bonsai trees. Our original intent for vis=
iting this out-of-the-ordinary establishment was to view the incredibly w=
ell-kept bonsai garden. My boyfriend's mom and I are great fans of tiny f=
oliage.
