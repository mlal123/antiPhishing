ature appears to play content from NPR in the U.S. and BBC in the U.K. Dur=
ing the initial rollout to beta users=2C the feature defaulted to The Wash=

Stratechery / Ben Thompson
Is Facebook telling us the whole story about why it=E2=80=99s changing New=
s Feed? =E2=86=92 (https://stratechery.com/2018/facebooks-motivations/)
=E2=80=9CThis change could have been made and justified without even broac=
hing the idea that Facebook might be bad for you; why did Facebook rest ev=
erything on that reasoning?=E2=80=9D

AP launches @APFactCheck on Twitter =E2=86=92 (https://blog.ap.org/announc=
ements/bringing-ap-fact-checks-to-twitter?utm_campaign=3DSocialFlow)
=E2=80=9CThe Twitter account will give us a dedicated platform to quickly=
 deliver any live fact-checking we do around big events =E2=80=94 items th=
at have proven to be a huge success for us. Getting fact checks out on soc=
ial media as soon as possible also can be a major weapon in helping to deb=
unk trending false stories.=E2=80=9D
The Membership Puzzle Project / Emily Goligoski
When membership might not be your publication=E2=80=99s best path forward=
 =E2=86=92 (https://membershippuzzle.org/articles-overview/when-membership=
-might-not-be-your-publications-best-path-forward)
=E2=80=9CWe recommend membership as one of several revenue streams and one=
 that will likely generate less than 10 percent of total revenue in its fi=
rst year. Still=2C we=E2=80=99d be remiss not to share other membership li=
mitations with you =E2=80=94 and warn that it may not be rosy under these=
 conditions.=E2=80=9D

Babe=2C what are you doing? =E2=86=92 (https://jezebel.com/babe-what-are-y=

=E2=80=9CWrapping too much journalism around your brand is a mistake for a=
ny platform hoping to still make it into China=2C which is one of Mark Zuc=
kerberg=E2=80=99s great ambitions. Why own publishing companies also or be=

view-four-asian-publishers-news-feed-changes)
=E2=80=9CWe aren=E2=80=99t super concerned about Facebook=E2=80=99s algori=
thm change. For the last two years we=E2=80=99ve been working relentlessly=
 on diversifying away from the platform=2C and in 2017 Facebook accounted=
 for about 40 percent of our traffic.=E2=80=9D (40 percent!)
The Splice Newsroom / George Wright
A new English-language podcast in Vietnam wants to bring lively debate to=
 one of the region=E2=80=99s most restrictive media environments =E2=86=92=
 (https://www.thesplicenewsroom.com/saigoneer-podcast-vietnam-censored-med=
ia/)
=E2=80=9CThe creators hope the 30-minute episodes will expand on Saigoneer=
=E2=80=99s current model of blending lighthearted content with hard news.=
 But with the latter comes a need to carefully navigate what US non-govern=
mental organization Freedom House has called one of the harshest media env=
ironments in Asia.=E2=80=9D
Digiday / Max Willens
Axios plans to push into video=2C using the =E2=80=9Csmart brevity=E2=80=

gas-axios-ceo-jim-vandehei-says-high-priced-subs-will-come-years-end/)
=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re not at all Facebook-dependent. Twenty percent of ou=
r traffic is direct; 20 percent is Google; we get a lot from Flipboard. We=
 do well with Facebook. Some Reddit. Year one=2C we focused mainly on text=
=2E In year two=2C you=E2=80=99re going to see a big push into video as we t=
ake the smart brevity concept and apply it to video.=E2=80=9D
