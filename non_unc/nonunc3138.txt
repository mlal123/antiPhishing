Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Splay Class  (10/21/16 12:00 PM)

Why do we need a new splay class and interface? Why can we not implement it just as a method of BST_Node?

------------------------------------------------------------
Insert returns boolean  (10/21/16 12:42 PM)

For BST A2, we made the insert method return a boolean.

In the descriptions you wrote "return: void, if you need to update size when delegating, consider using a boolean as I mention in BST_Node."

Does this mean we can switch the void method to a boolean method?
