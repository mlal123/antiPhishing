Say sorry to all of you TAT  (10/14/16 4:53 PM)

I am so sorry that my meeting takes longer than I expected, so I haven't come back on time. And the graphics class takes another 30 minutes at the beginning.
Could you send your code & questions to my email? My mail box is airsplay@cs.unc.edu. I will figure it out in the weekend. Sorry about that again and hope that you could forgive me TAT...
