Here's what has happened in COMP 435 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Class on Oct. 18  (10/05/17 1:52 PM)

The class schedule on the website says "Fall Break" on Wed, Oct. 18 - I can't remember if Prof. Sturton said yesterday in class whether a guest lecture is on next Wednesday, or the one after (18th). Is 18th the one?

Problem with my VM on Mac - anyone have the same issue?  (10/05/17 1:14 PM)

Getting this when I open the VM on my 2013/14 (unsure) MacBook Pro- went to office hours and they told me it should look very different from this. Any tips on what to change to make this work? Has/does anyone have the same issue?
