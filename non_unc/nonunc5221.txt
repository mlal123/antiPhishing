This Week in Tech: Programming Turns 70
---------------------------------------

April 12th, 1947: ENIAC ( http://bit.ly/2pv9l4J ), the
world's first general-purpose programmable electronic computer,
ran the first code written in the modern paradigm, marking the
birth of computer programming as a profession.

* This first test code ran computations for the hydrogen bomb.
* ENIAC could perform complex coded operations like loops, seen
today in languages like JavaScript ( https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn=
-javascript?utm_source=3Dcustomerio&utm_medium=3DFortnightly-2017-04-19&utm=
_campaign=3Dnewsletter_b&utm_content=3Dhistory ), Ruby ( https://www.codeca=
demy.com/learn/ruby?utm_source=3Dcustomerio&utm_medium=3DFortnightly-2017-0=
4-19&utm_campaign=3Dnewsletter_b&utm_content=3Dhistory ) and Python ( https=

tnightly-2017-04-19&utm_campaign=3Dnewsletter_b&utm_content=3Dhistory ).
* These first professional programmers were all women, a fact
that took 50 years to be recognized ( http://bit.ly/2pv9eGt ).

Coding ENIAC to solve a single problem would take weeks.
Today, you can build a website ( https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-we=
