Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Computing Average  (10/19/15 3:15 PM)

Am I allowed to declare "sum" in the second part of the loop, where I am on=
ly supposed to print average? I can find no other way to find the average w=
ithout declaring a sum value and then dividing by the amount of # in the ar=
ray.=C2=A0

The instructions here:
"=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0If the user entered 2, then compute the average of all e=
ntries in the array. Create a=C2=A0double=C2=A0variable named=C2=A0average=
=C2=A0and then save the result into the variable"

kind of make it seem like you should only have to declare an average variab=
le to get it.=C2=A0

------------------------------------------------------------
Array size  (10/19/15 3:27 PM)

When we ask for the array size are we asking for number of elements, for ex=
ample if the person inputs 2, will we have the number of elements be 2 or 3=
 because we use index 0, 1, 2?
