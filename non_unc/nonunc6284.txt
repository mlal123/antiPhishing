Dear Students, Faculty and Staff: 

You are receiving this email as part of a TEST of the University's emergency sirens. This message coincides with the end of the emergency sirens test. The sirens have sounded the "all clear" tone. You may resume normal activities. 

In an emergency, we will use all available communication methods including email as part of a multi-layered strategy to reach as many people, including those who may not be on campus when emergency sirens occur, as quickly as possible. For more information, see alertcarolina.unc.edu.

Thank you for your participation in the University's regularly scheduled Alert Carolina sirens test.
