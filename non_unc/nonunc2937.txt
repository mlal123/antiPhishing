Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Exam/class curve  (10/05/16 2:46 AM)

I looked in the Syllabus, but there is nothing about the grade distribution=
 or exam curves.=C2=A0

Does COMP 411 usually have an exam curve or class curve? And what is the gr=
ade distribution (i.e. what is the cutoff for an "A")?=C2=A0

Thanks!
