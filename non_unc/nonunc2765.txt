Here's what has happened in COMP 411 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Lab4 simple in and outs cannot be accessed  (9/22/16 2:59 PM)

Whenever I access the sample inputs and outputs of lab4, I get a permission=
 denied error

Lab4 auto-checking for ex2  (9/22/16 4:06 PM)

For exercise 2 of lab 4, when running the automatic checking program, I alw=
ays obtained the error files, and the error files don't contain the differe=
nt outputs but only contains one line:

Binary files /home/lastra/comp411/samples/lab4/ex2out1 and ex2result1 diffe=
r

Is this an error of the checking program? Examining by eyes, I can't find a=
ny differences between the example output and my output. Does anyone else h=
ave the same problem? Thanks.

Quiz 3 Grade not counting  (9/22/16 5:02 PM)

Hello,
Does anyone know of any particular reason why the quiz grade for quiz 3 is =
not factored into the quiz category average? On Sakai, it states that my qu=
iz grade was (X/10), and then states that grades in parenthesis do not coun=
t in the course grade calculation. Thanks for any help!=C2=A0
