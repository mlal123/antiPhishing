Here's what has happened in COMP 410 (section 002) on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
Can we assume priorities will always be positive integers (and/or zero)?  (=
9/27/16 6:27 PM)

Since constructing a new MinBinHeap object fills position zero in the array=
 with an entrypair that has a priority =C2=A0of -100000, can we assume a pr=
iority will never be lower than that?=C2=A0

I implemented insert recursively and would like to know if I need to explic=
itly check if at index 0 (the way I check priority works if I can assume th=
at a priority won't be less than that).

No big deal if we do, logic isn't hard to adjust.=C2=A0
