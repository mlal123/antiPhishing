Here's what has happened in COMP 110 on Piazza:

------------------------------------------------------------
testing the holding method  (11/05/15 10:38 PM)

Beginning the test, when i'm prompted the "Please press 1 to hold, or press=
 2 to roll again" and I input 1, the test continues on until I reach the en=
d and says that I passed; but if i input 2 instead, it prints out "When use=
r presses 1 Expected:true Returned:false ... error(s) :("=C2=A0

Is there an error in my programming or is it the test case?
