Hello! Reminder that I'm holding a PM session RIGHT NOW in Genome Cafe! I actually have a table for once so take advantage of this special occasion and come do some biology! This is a wonderful time to start preparing for next weeks test before all of your lives get really crazy and exciting due to the upcoming basketball games(s)! I'll be here until 1:30
