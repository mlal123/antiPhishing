Hi all,

Reversing the announcement I made on Piazza a day or so ago, we now advise=
=C2=A0you to use TA office hours to resolve grading enquiries about the hom=
ework assignments, and to=C2=A0not use email to contact us regarding regrad=
ing. Apologies for the confusion. For those of you who have already used em=
ail to get your homework regraded, there is nothing to be done. For those o=
f you who plan to request regrading on Homework 1 or any future assignment,=
 please use our office hours.
