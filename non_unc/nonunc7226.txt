Hi Mangza,

Jen Halsey has shared your resume and contact info with me and I'd like to
followup and schedule a call with you at your earliest convenience.

Swim.it is a company I started a few years ago aiming to build a software
business around an innovative software stack which is focused on realtime
edge data insights and learning.

We did our Series A in January and have a lot of exciting work to do with
customers and in building out our core software.

Is there a good time for you on Friday or Monday when we could schedule a
call?

Thanks, Rusty
