Chen--Question#1 in 16.6WA

If you were asked to identify=C2=A0the surface with the vector equation:=C2=
=A0r(u,=C2=A0v) =3D (u=C2=A0+=C2=A0v)=C2=A0i=C2=A0+ (4=C2=A0=E2=88=92=C2=A0=
v)=C2=A0j=C2=A0+ (1=C2=A0+=C2=A03u=C2=A0+=C2=A06v)=C2=A0k, and you rewrite =
the equation into <0, 4,1> + u<1, 0, 3> +v<1, -1, 6>, how would you be able=
 to recognize that it is an expression of a plane?=C2=A0
