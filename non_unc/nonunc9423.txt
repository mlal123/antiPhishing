Career Management
Identify and articulate one's
skills, strengths, knowledge, and experiences relevant to the position desi=
red
and career goals, and identify areas necessary for professional growth. The
individual is able to navigate and explore job options, understands and can
take the steps necessary to pursue opportunities, and understands how to
self-advocate for opportunities in the workplace.=20





Career Management sounds like
something that  you can only master after being a working professional for
years. However, that just not the case. The concept of the competency means
that you are learning to articulate your interests and skills and how those=
 in
turn match with the specific duties within a job. Being able to set some go=
als
for yourself as well as outline the steps you need to take to achieve those
goals.  Your career is a path and not a destination. You will do many
things along this path, the important takeaway is to become an even stronge=
r,
more skilled professional with each opportunity.
