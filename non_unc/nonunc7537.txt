Acknowledgment Size  (11/28/17 11:53 AM)

Hi,
My group has used a large variety of documents to gather information about our topic, so much so that the acknowledgements section will not be enough to display them. To keep from having an ugly "wall of text" poster that is mostly acknowledgements and to allow us to use the space on our poster for actual material, is it OK for us to just include one or two primary sources on the front of the poster, and then tape on the rest of the bibliography on the back or something?

Citations in the Poster  (11/28/17 11:24 AM)

If we use quotes or visuals from a source, how should we cite them on the poster?
