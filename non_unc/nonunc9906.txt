Imagine you had the resources of multi-billion dollar companies=E2=80=A6

  



And you had A.I with 100x the power and 100x the speed of anything curre=
ntly available.  

  



What would you create with that A.I?

  



What if we said=E2=80=A6 that dream tech is called Augmented Random Sear=
ch.=20

  



And ARS i=

But those who do, will be able to change the world as we know it and eve=

And we want you to master this technology too.

  



So, after weeks of blood, sweat and tears, Hadelin and I proudly present=

Artificial =

It was a particularly HUGE challenge to create this course.

  



AI technology is evolving quicker than what experts believed =E2=80=93 k=
eeping up and mastering these ever-changing developments is no easy feat.=20

  



We wanted a course that not only showed you how to use Augmented Random =
Search, but how to intuitively understand the concepts behind it.=20

  



In short: We challenged ourselves=E2=80=A6

  



To Create A Course Th=
at Would Empower You With AI

  



We wanted a course specifically designed for AI 2018 - deep theory, intu=
ition, step-by-step instructions and plenty of practical activities.

  



And that=E2=80=99s exactly what you=E2=80=99ll get!

  



On top of the theory that you=E2=80=99ll need to make this AI tech secon=
d nature to you, you=E2=80=99ll learn how to code your very own A.I and tea=
ch it how to WALK and RUN!

  



In short, A.I 2018=E2=84=A2 will guide you not only to understand this r=
evolutionary technology, but also to build real-world solutions with it.=20

  



Does That Sound E=

Well, guess what...

  



There's more!

  



We value our existing students and that's why we've prepared something e=
