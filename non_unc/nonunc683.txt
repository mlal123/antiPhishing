Hi Mangza,

I'm not sure if you got my earlier email, because there's been some 
weird email stuff going on. Here's the text of that email:

All your points seem to be valid, and your overall thesis is very good- 
it certainly derives something interesting from the reading we have done 
so far this semester.

What play are you using besides /Medea/? You clearly have some points 
marked out, but from which play? Several could work, of course, but 
which one in particular? I'm especially interested because I think that 
considering your thesis, you need to address Apollo's assertion at the 
end of the /Furies /that marriage relationships are actually more 
important than kin relationships. There are several ways you can get 
around this, but since it's an obvious counter-example you should 
probably save a paragraph or two to address it.

All-in-all, this looks very good early in the game. Good luck writing!


I also want to ask you to send future emails to my school address: 
emmanw@live.unc.edu. You're more likely to get a quick response from 
there than from this address.
                         -Emma
