Conditional Probability  (9/25/17 12:32 PM)

I might've missed someone mentioning this in class, but will the conditional probability formulas be something we have to memorize entirely? Or will they be given to us for the exam? One formula being: P(A|B)=(P(B|A)) * (P(A)/P(B)).

Finding P(B) and P(B|A) only by knowing P(A) and P(B|~A)  (9/25/17 11:21 AM)

On the slides, there is this image:


It seems to suggest that if you know P(true ID) and P(match | not true ID), then you can determine P(true ID | match). I haven't taken a statistics class in a long time, so this might be common knowledge, but is this supposed to possible? In the review session, we were given the formula P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B) . We were also given the formula P(B) = P(B|A)*P(A) + P(B|~A)*P(~A). In order to use those formulas and get the final answer for P(A|B), you need to know P(B) and P(B|A). So basically what I am wondering is, how can you derive P(B|A) from just those two given values, P(A) and P(B|~A). Or is that not possible and the slides are misleading, or is there just a way easier formula to calculate this instead of the one from the review session?
