Last Minute Office Hours

There was a bit of a misunderstanding on my part involving a switch of some office hours sections, so unfortunately I miss my time slots earlier today. To make up for it I'm going to be offering some last minute office hours from 9:00-11:00 tomorrow morning, September 19th. I don't know if either of the rooms are free so as of right now I'll plan on being in the lobby of Sitterson, I'll update this post if that changes.
