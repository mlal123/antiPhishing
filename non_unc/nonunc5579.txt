Dear Students, Faculty and Staff: 

You are receiving this email as part of a TEST of the University?s emergency sirens. This message coincides with the beginning of the emergency sirens test. During the test, anyone outside on or near campus likely will hear the sirens. The sirens are not designed to be heard inside a building or vehicle.

NO ACTION is required. Again, this is only a TEST.

The University tests the sirens to remind everyone what to do if they hear the sirens sound for a real emergency and to make sure the equipment works properly.

In the event of a real emergency, University police advises all students, faculty and staff to:

  - Go inside immediately.
  - Close windows and doors.
  - Stay until further notice.
  - Follow directions from emergency responders or University officials.

In an emergency, we will also use all available communication methods as part of a multi-layered strategy to reach as many people, including those who may not be on campus when emergency sirens occur, as quickly as possible.
